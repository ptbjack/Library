Anxiety pertaining to femininity as essentially a masquerade.[^1]
* Not a dread of being punished for stealing the father's property, but more fundamentally, the anxiety of literally *being nothing*.
* The subject hinges on the mask, under the mask, there is nothing but sheer ontological anxiety.
* Lacan: this **radical ontological anxiety is the prerogative of subjectivity as such. Subject as such is feminine.**
* Man believes that he is (exists), "male anxiety" usually stops at castration anxiety. Man is the subject who believes he is man. Masculinity is a question of belief based on, and sustained by, the repression of castration.
