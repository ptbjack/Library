Reality testing: in relation to objects that the subject does find in reality, she can only say "this is not it" (in comparison to the presupposed fullness of primary satisfaction).[^1]
- "It is not mother" can attest to the fullness of the Mother ("Mother is", this person in my dream is nothing close to her).
- The existence of things is marked by a lack of something that forms the perspective on what is there.
	- Transcendental constitution of reality qua Freud: "speculative" subtraction of something that was never "objectively" there, yet the hole involved in its absence functions as the armature of objective reality.
- The end of analysis would be abandoning the thing in itself while preserving the gap that separates IT from the phenomenal reality, articulating this gap as a function of an immanent transcendence.
