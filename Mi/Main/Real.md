* Purely formal materialism of the difference.
    * Primordial fact is pure, self difference.
    * Multitude is an effect of the inconsistency of the One itself.

# Lacanian Real and Badiou's Event[^3]
* Lacan: the Real is the point of the internal impossibility of being: in order to speak of "being qua being", one has to amputate something in being that is not being.
	* The law of the discourse on being-qua-being is a consequence of an impossibility with which it occurs.
	* All being is discursive, but the discursive is non-all.
	* Impossibility that pertains to being and not only to the Event.
	* Discourse is implied in the gap.
* Badiou: ontology prohibits the Event.
     * The prohibition of the Event is the "consequence of a law of the discourse on being-qua-being".
    * Being-qua-being is pure inconsistent multiplicity.
        * The discursive is only a presentation of this multiplicity, involving a "count-as-one".
    * Excess takes place on the level of what is already counted-for-one, on the level of presentation, as the excess of the parts of a given multiple or set over its elements.

[[Badiou]]: Lacan is wrong in thinking that we cannot speak about the Real and that there is no truth about the real.[^2]
* But, [[Lacan]]: we cannot speak about the Real because speech is too close to it, because it can never fully escape the Real, but holds onto it.
    * The Real is the inherent contradiction of speech.
* Paradox indicates that language cannot be neatly separated from the Real (the impossibility of saying it all).
* The place/position of truth is the point where speech "slips," "lapses" int the Real that it tries to articulate.
