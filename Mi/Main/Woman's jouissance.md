[[Formulas of sexuation]]
S(Ⱥ) : enjoyment appearing at the place of the gap of the non-emergence of one signifier is that of the unconscious, not as repressed, but as the very substance of the missing signifier which, as missing, gives its form to the unconscious.[^1]
- Limits of [[knowledge]]: one cannot know anything about non-phallic enjoyment, this enjoyment is not an object of knowledge because it is a place-holder for the knowledge which does not exist. This enjoyment appears because there is nothing to know there.
	* _Woman's jouissance is the signifier of the lack of knowledge (in the Other); marks the point where the Other does not know._
	* If there was 'sexual relation', there would be its signifier (knowledge) in the Other. Since there is a [[Non-relation]], there is this other enjoyment.
* "Feminine jouissance" is not an obstacle to the sexual relation, but a symptom of its nonexistence.
- the relation with S(Ⱥ) puts us on the path of "ex-sistence".
