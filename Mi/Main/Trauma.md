If one starts from the primary character of the pleasure principle (pleasure= lowering of tension), why would somebody be compelled to repeat a distinctly unpleasant experience?
* [[Freud]]: repetition appears at the place of remembering; one repeats something one cannot remember. What the compulsion to repeat repeats is not some traumatic experience, but something which could never register as an experience to begin with.
    * **Trauma is real, but not experienced**: it is outside the horizon of experience (it is constitutive of it).
    * Objectivity of trauma (independence from 'psychic life') is the condition of us having a 'psychic life' (and experiencing something as "traumatic")
    * [[Laplanche]]: reality of the [[enigmatic messages]].
* [[Malabou]]: trauma is not real, it is psychologically mediated.
    * [[Zupancic]]: mediation comes from the outside. It is not a screen separating us from the Real, but is itself partaking in the Real. **Mediation is the trauma (trauma as Real)**.
