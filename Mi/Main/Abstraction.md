Abstraction, LGBT+, function of the plus is not empirical, + is the position of feminine [[Hysteria]]. Perverts always know what they are, don't question their position. Hysteria is subject, "what object am I for the desire out there".[^1]

Subject involves abstraction, abstraction as historical fact.[^1]
- Bourgeois society, you relate to yourself as an abstract [[Bourgeois Individual]].
	- Gender, every positive feature is mediated, you are not-that.
	- Desire, object of desire is the + at the end of the object chain (objet a).
- The only totality that you get is brutal totality based on brutal abstraction.
