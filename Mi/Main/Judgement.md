Two decisions in the function of judgement:[^1]
* Affirmation or not of the possession by a thing of a particular attribute.
    * "It shall be inside me" or "it shall be outside me".
    * The original pleasure-ego wants to introject into itself everything that is good and to eject from itself everything that is bad.
        * Bad = external = alien
* Assert or dispute that a presentation has an existence in reality
    * Reality-testing
    * Reality-ego, which develops out of the initial pleasure-ego
    * Whether something which is in the ego as a presentation can be re-discovered in perception (reality) as well
        * Inside (subjective, presentation) vs outside
        * All presentations originate from perceptions and are repetitions of them
        * First aim of reality-testing is not to find an object in real perception which corresponds to the one presented, but to REFIND such an object, to convince oneself that it is still there.
 * Judging is not a purely passive process, it is a continuation of the original process by which the ego took things into itself or expelled them from itself according to the pleasure principle.
