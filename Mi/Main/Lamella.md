[[Lacan]]: think of [[Libido]] not as energy but lamella, an â€˜unreal organ'[^1]
- Like amoeba, extra-flat, immortal (survives any division). 
- Instead of Aristophanian myth of humans having Oneness and later split.
- Loss is not in splitting but with the occurrence of sexual reproduction.
	- Joining, not adding, has constitutive loss or reduction.
- Libido = loss
