Modern bourgeois form, [[property]] is based on **the antagonism of capital and wage-labor**:[^1]
- Capital is a social power: it can be set in motion only by the united action of all members of society.
- When capital is converted into common property, it loses its class-character.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.
