Modern bourgeois form, [[property]] is based on **the antagonism of capital and wage-labor**:[^1]
- Capital is a social power: it can be set in motion only by the united action of all members of society.
- When capital is converted into common property, it loses its class-character.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.

Capitalism is insufficiently evolved to survive the technologies it spawns.[^2]
- Capitalism is irrational; fails to make rational use of the brilliant machines it engenders.
- The trick is to help speed up capital's development while resisting its tendency to steamroll over our human spirit.
