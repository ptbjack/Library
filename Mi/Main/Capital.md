[[Capitalism]]
Modern bourgeois form, [[property]] is based on **the antagonism of capital and wage-labor**:[^1]
- Capital is a social power: it can be set in motion only by the united action of all members of society.
- When capital is converted into common property, it loses its class-character.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.

[[Zizek]]: Hegel wasn't Hegelian enough when confronting capital. He interpreted estates (state, farm, commerce) as intersubjective bonds, missed how labor power itself becomes a commodity under capitalism.[^2]
- Marx explained self-reproduction of capital in purely Hegelian terms; substance becomes subject.
