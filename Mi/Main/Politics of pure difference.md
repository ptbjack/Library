Politics of pure difference:[^1]
* NOT identity politics, of recognizing the differences.
	* Logic of their struggle is that of recognizing differences: each identity having freedom to deploy itself.
* Universality is not an encompassing container of positions, it is that of the struggle itself.
* Position of struggle not that of a particular identity, abandoning universal truth.
* There is universal truth of a situation, accessible only through a partial position.
	* [[Conflictual Sciences]]
* Notion of collective; universality accessible to engaged, subjective position.
