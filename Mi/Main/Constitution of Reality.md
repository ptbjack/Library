The cut between inside and outside, between affirmation and negation, produces three things: (1) affirmation (positivity), (2) negation (absence, what is not), (3) the place, locus, of their difference.[^1]
- The step from the original *Lust-Ich* to subjectivity proper is that of including the difference (gap/crack) that separates "me" from the outside. The negativity included in the subject is the very form of negation which reveals its structure of with-without. Cutting off of the future outside reality leaves a mark, which is what the subject relies upon in its constitution.
- The negation of "not-mother" allows for the symptomatic formulation, inscription of mother in reality.
- The question to be asked is what is in the mother herself that enables her repression (the point of impossibility that determines her in her structural reality).
- Transcendental constitution of reality qua Freud: "speculative" subtraction of something that was never "objectively" there, yet the hole involved in its absence functions as the armature of objective reality
