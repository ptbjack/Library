Politics and psychoanalysis:[^1]
	1- One tends to leave sexuality out
	2- Or, Western ideology; combination of moral liberalism and political conservatism
* Both mistaken:
    * First dismisses sexuality as *something* that has a secondary, regional relevance.
    * Second dismisses politics as *something* that is necessarily pathological.
    * "Something", the Real is precisely not being, but its inherent impasse.

That which is not in the sexual is the relation: [[Non-relation]]

"The sexual is political", as in, a true emancipatory politics can be thought only on the ground of an "object-disoriented ontology": ontology that does not purse being qua being, but but the crack (the [[Real]], the antagonism) that haunts being from within.

Emancipation is most often conceived in terms of freeing ourselves from the social non-relation, Lacan says the opposite: the aim to abolish the non-relation is the trademark of all social repression.[^2]
* Oppressive societies: if there is to be a relation, women need to be such and such.
	* Oppressive society forces the impossible.
* Contemporary "secular" form of social order and domination abandoned the idea of a harmonious totality to the advantage of the idea of a non-totalizable multiplicity of singularities forming a "democratic" network.
* [[Platonov]]'s Anti-Sexus aims to separate sex from the Other.
	* The crucial obstacle to global human emancipation is humanity itself, to solve it, Anti-Sexus proposes to canalize the disruptive element.
	* Anti-Sexus only provides to remove the Other from sex, not a method to remove sex from the Other.
* Psychoanalysis: Woman does not exist = there is no neutrality of social being, social being is fundamentally biased.
	* Discursive space is biased by the missing element of the relation.
	* Neutral social being represses consequential negativity. It is another form of the narrative of the relation, it is accompanied by the idea of some kind of self-regulation.
	    * E.g. "the invisible hand of the market"	
	 - ==Choice is not between relation and non-relation, it is between different kinds of relations that are being formed in the discursive space curved by the non-relation.==
