Politics and psychoanalysis:[^1]
	1- One tends to leave sexuality out
	2- Or, Western ideology; combination of moral liberalism and political conservatism
* Both mistaken:
    * First dismisses sexuality as *something* that has a secondary, regional relevance.
    * Second dismisses politics as *something* that is necessarily pathological.
    * "Something", the Real is precisely not being, but its inherent impasse.

That which is not in the sexual is the relation: [[Non-relation]]

"The sexual is political", as in, a true emancipatory politics can be thought only on the ground of an "object-disoriented ontology": ontology that does not purse being qua being, but but the crack (the [[Real]], the antagonism) that haunts being from within.

Sexuality as an immediate political problem.
* Feminism: always been political movement.
    * Depends on positing sexual difference as a political problem, and hence on situating it in the context of social antagonism and of emancipatory struggle.
    * Doesn't try to affirm some other, female identity, starts from the fact that "women" were nonexistent in a political sense.
        * Nonexistence functioned as a homogeneity of the political space, feminism transformed it into a split which concerns all.
        * Split is not independently existing ontological divide (men vs women) but something that constitutes sexual difference as difference.
            * Traditional division between masculine and feminine worlds does not see sexual difference as difference. Unity is not threatened by this "difference".
    * Female identity sustains exclusion.
        * ==Emancipatory politics begins with "loss of identity", which is good.==
    - Capacity to inscribe the problem of division and difference into the world the homogeneity of which is based on exclusion.
        * **Exclusion of the split as such, erasing of a social antagonism.**
* Sexual difference is not that between different identities, but as an ontological impossibility (implied in sexuality) which opens up the space of the social (where identities are also generated).
    * Ontologically determinative negativity, lost with its replacement with "gender differences."
        * [[Copjec]]: **gender theory removed the sex from sex**: the sex of sexual difference dropped out when this term was replaced by gender.

Emancipation is most often conceived in terms of freeing ourselves from the social non-relation, Lacan says the opposite: the aim to abolish the non-relation is the trademark of all social repression.[^2]
* Oppressive societies: if there is to be a relation, women need to be such and such.
	* Oppressive society forces the impossible.
* Contemporary "secular" form of social order and domination abandoned the idea of a harmonious totality to the advantage of the idea of a non-totalizable multiplicity of singularities forming a "democratic" network.
* [[Platonov]]'s Anti-Sexus aims to separate sex from the Other.
	* The crucial obstacle to global human emancipation is humanity itself, to solve it, Anti-Sexus proposes to canalize the disruptive element.
	* Anti-Sexus only provides to remove the Other from sex, not a method to remove sex from the Other.
* Psychoanalysis: Woman does not exist = there is no neutrality of social being, social being is fundamentally biased.
	* Discursive space is biased by the missing element of the relation.
	* Neutral social being represses consequential negativity. It is another form of the narrative of the relation, it is accompanied by the idea of some kind of self-regulation.
	    * E.g. "the invisible hand of the market"	
	 - ==Choice is not between relation and non-relation, it is between different kinds of relations that are being formed in the discursive space curved by the non-relation.==
