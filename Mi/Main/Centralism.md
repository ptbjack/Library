International Communist Current:[^1]
- Centralism is the concretization of the organization's unitary character.
	- the **whole** of the organisation takes precedence before the parts.
	- the parts are delegated by the whole organisation.
- Voting and elections are the best way of ensuring unity and widest participation of the whole organisation in its own life.
- There is no **proportional representation** of minority positions within the central organ.
	- Bourgeois organisation , the existence of divergences is based on defence of the interests of this or that sector, interests which have to be conciliated by 'fair' distribution of posts among their representatives.
	- Communist organisation, divergences express a living and dynamic process of clarification of problems posed to the class.
- **democratic centralism** must be rejected:
	- marked by seal of Stalinism which used it to cover up liquidation of revolutionary life in the parties of the CI.
	- [[@V. I. Lenin]] himself wrongly asked for the banning of fractions
	- hierarchical and 'military' character of the organisation should be rejected.
- **organic** ([[@Amadeo Bordigo]]) must be rejected:
	- Bordigism used the fact that a majority doesn't guarantee a correct position to ban votes and elections
	- leaders arise 'by themselves' through organic process: means giving the 'center' the job of deciding everything, leading this 'center' to align itself behind the positions of a **historic leader** who has divine infallibility.
