The comic feeling and the feeling of the [[Uncanny]](Unheimliche) are two modes of deploying the Nothing.[^1]
* They share ‘materiality of the spectral’ and the production of the ‘impossible’ objects
* [[Pfaller]]: four essential commonalities:
	* Symbolic causality (something starts as a play and takes the upper hand, functioning in the real)
	* Success (everything succeeds too much)
	* repetition
	* Figure of the double

Comedy is what is uncanny for others:[^1]
- Mannoni’s example of dead man on stage, sneezing
	- Could be [[Fetishistic Disavowal]]: We can ‘believe’ what is on stage by presupposing some others who would believe the performance real (identifying with the gaze of the Other who is supposedly fooled by the performance).
		-  But we lose the third reality which cannot be reduced to empirical reality or the illusion sustained by fetishistic disavowal: Theatrical reality has same status as the ‘material reality of [[Enigmatic Messages]]’ of Laplanche.
		- Question of truth concerns the relationship between what we see and the real that structures it.
		-  We delegate our explicit knowledge of ‘how things really stand’ to the Other, so that we can indulge in believing what we see, the Other is the guarantee that outside the play there is a reality firmly in its place.

Difference between comedy and the uncanny:[^1]
* Uncanny relies on the structure of desire, based on the antinomy of the object of desire and its transcendent cause.
	* Object-cause is constitutively excluded from the field of desire, from the Other.
	* If the object-cause emerges on the level of the Other, it produces the uncanny.
		* The figure of the double is the mirror image in which the object a is included. Imaginary coincides with the real, provokes anxiety.
			* Double = me + a
			* We see the a with a nod or wink, or mirror image closes its eyes, makes gaze appear.
		* Over-realization of embracing the Cause in self-destruction is what desire fantasizes about.
		* Realism of desire: the constitutive lack cannot come to be lacking without the reality constructed around this lack falling apart.
* Comedy has an unrealistic stance: the lack comes to lack, the ghastly object appears where it should not, the Other and the object appear on the same level. Nothing really happens though.
	* Incredible + down-to-earth realism
	* Vitalism: realism of drives.
		* Realism of the death drive; vitalism of the internal contradiction of human life itself.
		* Excess of life
	* *Constitutive dislocation*: the object of comedy is the interval that separates and links  the sneezing and its body, the habit and its bearer.
