[[Forced Choice]]

Freedom only appears when something has a cause.[^1]
- Cause is discontinuity ([[Causality]])

Bourgeois conditions: free trade, free selling and buying. These have no meaning opposed to Communistic abolition of buying and selling.[^2]

Freedom is being stuck onto something.[^3]
- Hegel: being stuck onto particular something is ultimate assertion of autonomy.
- The object doesn't matter, the message ([[Enigmatic Messages]]) is my arbitrary fixation.
