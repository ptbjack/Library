[[Freud]]: sexuality is a paradox-ridden deviation from a norm that does not exist.[^1]
- Aberrant’ mechanisms (deviation from object, reproductive aim) are also present in what is considered to be ‘natural’ sexual behavior.
- Drives are partial, aimless, and independent of their object to start with. They do not become such due to some ulterior deviation.
- There is no ‘natural’ or pre-established place of human sexuality, it is constitutively out-of-place.
	- No substance to be properly described and circumscribed, it is the very impossibility of its own circumscription or delimitation.
	- [[Lacan]]: the Sexual does not exist, there is only the sexual that insists/persists as a constitutive imbalance of the human being.
	- The sexual (constitutively deviational partial drives) is not the ultimate horizon of the “human” animal, or the anchor point of irreducible humanity, it is the operator of the inhuman, of dehumanization.[^3]
- “Normal” human sexuality is a paradoxical, artificial naturalization of the originally denatured drives. Human sexuality is “sexual” insofar as the unification at stake never really works, but allows for different partial drives to continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity.[^4]

Sex vs unicorns:[^6]
* Unicorn, we have the idea, but it is nowhere to be found empirically.
* Sex, we recognize empirically, but we don't have the Idea of sex (Plato), its essence.
    * Presenting sex as low and "dirty" is already a response to a fundamental scandal - that we don't know what it is.
    * There is sex only in something that does not work.
    * Culture is not simply a mask/veil of the sexual, it is the mask for something in the sexual which "is not".
        * Freud: civilization is sexually driven; it is driven by that which is not.

 All satisfaction of a need allows for another satisfaction to occur, which tends to become independent and self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself. There is no pure natural need devoid of this surplus element which splits it from within. This split is the site of grounding of human sexuality.[^1]

The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.[^3]
- “For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- [[Sublimation]]

==What sexualizes infantile pleasure is the encounter with the unconscious of adults, a minus (something that comes only as missing from its place in the Other).==[^4]
- There is something about sexuality that appears only as repressed, something that registers in reality only in the form of repression (not as something that is, then repressed)
- Strong social pressure put on “natural sexuality” to function as the norm is there to hide an abyssal negativity of natural sexuality itself, more than to keep the supposedly disruptive partial drives away.[^5]
	- ==Nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our Other) in the first place.== Culture is not something that denatures, splits natural sexuality; it is being generated at the very locus where something in nature (as sexual nature) is lacking. Humanity is that point of Nature where its lack of “knowledge” (of sexual law) acquires a singular epistemic form, the point of a specific articulation of Nature’s own inherent negativity.
- The norm emerges at the point of this lack in representation; the norm takes the place of the image that “one has never seen”, that of a body completely wrapping itself around the Other’s body.
	- The fantasy is sustained by the imposition of the norm, sustaining the norm in turn: the fantasy of sexual relation.

‘The sexual’ as the psychoanalytic name for the inconsistency of being.
- The sexual is the edge of meaning, inner limit; the point of consistency of being that induces production of meaning.
- Sexual meanings revealed in therapy mask the reality of [[Drive]], it is a means of satisfaction through meaning [[Jouis-sense]], satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. Psychoanalysis tries to deactivate the path of this satisfaction, to make it useless.[^2][^3]
- [[Heidegger]]: being-towards-death → [[Lacan]]: being-towards-sex.[^2]
