[[Freud]]: sexuality is a paradox-ridden deviation from a norm that does not exist.[^1]
- Aberrant’ mechanisms (deviation from object, reproductive aim) are also present in what is considered to be ‘natural’ sexual behavior.
- Drives are partial, aimless, and independent of their object to start with. They do not become such due to some ulterior deviation.
- There is no ‘natural’ or pre-established place of human sexuality, it is constitutively out-of-place.
	- No substance to be properly described and circumscribed, it is the very impossibility of its own circumscription or delimitation.
	- [[Lacan]]: the Sexual does not exist, there is only the sexual that insists/persists as a constitutive imbalance of the human being.
	- The sexual (constitutively deviational partial drives) is not the ultimate horizon of the “human” animal, or the anchor point of irreducible humanity, it is the operator of the inhuman, of dehumanization.[^3]
- “Normal” human sexuality is a paradoxical, artificial naturalization of the originally denatured drives. Human sexuality is “sexual” insofar as the unification at stake never really works, but allows for different partial drives to continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity.[^4]


Sex vs unicorns:[^6]
* Unicorn, we have the idea, but it is nowhere to be found empirically.
* Sex, we recognize empirically, but we don't have the Idea of sex (Plato), its essence.
    * Presenting sex as low and "dirty" is already a response to a fundamental scandal - that we don't know what it is.
    * There is sex only in something that does not work.
    * Culture is not simply a mask/veil of the sexual, it is the mask for something in the sexual which "is not".
        * Freud: civilization is sexually driven; it is driven by that which is not.

 All satisfaction of a need allows for another satisfaction to occur, which tends to become independent and self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself. There is no pure natural need devoid of this surplus element which splits it from within. This split is the site of grounding of human sexuality.[^1]

The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.[^3]
- “For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- [[Sublimation]]

==What sexualizes infantile pleasure is the encounter with the unconscious of adults, a minus (something that comes only as missing from its place in the Other).==[^4]
- There is something about sexuality that appears only as repressed, something that registers in reality only in the form of repression (not as something that is, then repressed)
- Strong social pressure put on “natural sexuality” to function as the norm is there to hide an abyssal negativity of natural sexuality itself, more than to keep the supposedly disruptive partial drives away.[^5]
	- ==Nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our Other) in the first place.== Culture is not something that denatures, splits natural sexuality; it is being generated at the very locus where something in nature (as sexual nature) is lacking. Humanity is that point of Nature where its lack of “knowledge” (of sexual law) acquires a singular epistemic form, the point of a specific articulation of Nature’s own inherent negativity.
- The norm emerges at the point of this lack in representation; the norm takes the place of the image that “one has never seen”, that of a body completely wrapping itself around the Other’s body.
	- The fantasy is sustained by the imposition of the norm, sustaining the norm in turn: the fantasy of sexual relation.


Psychoanalysis relates sexuality to an epistemological difficulty, with immanent ontological relevance.[^7]
* The reason why sexuality is closely related to the unconscious and to the mechanisms of repression is not its moral controversy, but_ its paradoxical ontological status_, manifesting itself as an _epistemological limit_.
    * Moral issues originate from its ontological problem.

Ontological investigation:[^7]
* Primitive science as a sexual technique; ontologies used to rely on sexual difference (ying-yang, water-fire etc.)
    * Sexual difference anchored in essentialism.
    * Traditional ontology was a machine for producing "masculine" and "feminine" essences, or, for grounding these essences in being.
* Modern science and philosophy "desexualized" reality, abandoned sexual difference as the organizing principle of reality.
    * Break with ontology tout court: modern science is not ontology, does not pretend to make ontological claims, _it also does not recognize that it is nevertheless making them._
    * Kant, if one can have no knowledge about things in themselves, the classical ontological of being qua being seems to lose its ground.
* Lacan and Freud on the same line with modern science; desexualization.
    * Lacan: psychoanalysis proceeds from the same status as Science itself. It implies no recognition of any substance on which it claims to operate, even that of sexuality.
    * The sexual in psychoanalysis is different form the sense-making combinatory game, it is something that disrupts this game and makes it impossible.
    * Psychoanalysis is coextensive with desexualization of reality, and absolutely uncompromising when it comes to the sexual as the irreducible Real (not substance).
        * Reduction of sex and the sexual to the point of ontological inconsistency, which, as such, is irreducible.
- ‘The sexual’ as the psychoanalytic name for the inconsistency of being.[^2]
	- The sexual is the edge of meaning, inner limit; the point of consistency of being that induces production of meaning.
	- Sexual meanings revealed in therapy mask the reality of [[Death drive]], it is a means of satisfaction through meaning [[Jouis-sense]], satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. Psychoanalysis tries to deactivate the path of this satisfaction, to make it useless.[^2][^3]
	- [[Heidegger]]: being-towards-death → [[Lacan]]: being-towards-sex.[^2]

Lacan v Butler:[^7]
* "Gender is social construct" is deadlocked, remains in the dichotomy nature/culture.
* [[Butler]]: gender is performative; actions create the essences that they express. Nothing preexists.
    * Dynamics of repetition opens up the only margin of freedom.
    * Performativity is different from linguistics in terms of time. Socio-symbolic constructs, through repetition, become nature.
        * Dialectics of nature and culture → internal dialectics of culture. Culture both produces and regulates "nature".
    * Performativity is a kind of onto-logy of the discursive, responsible for both the* logos* and the *being* of things.
 - Lacanian psychoanalysis seems compatible with performativity but is irreducibly different:
    * Not only does it have to take into account the real, Lacan takes the signifying order as the locus of a fundamental *split*.
    * The signifying order creates its own space, but something else gets added to it; something parasitic on performative productivity, produced with it and "on top of" it.
        * Collateral for the symbolic
        * The signifier also "produces" the dimension of the Real, related to the points of structural impossibility/contradiction of symbolic reality itself.
        * This is the dimension that sustains the "vital" phenomena (libido or jouissance, drive, sexualized body) in their out-of-jointness with the symbolic.
        * Responsible for the fact that the field of the Other is never neutral (or structured by pure differentiality), but conflictual, asymmetrical, "not-all", ridden with a fundamental antagonism.
            * Antagonism as such is not *between* different elements, it is the structuring principle of the elements involved in it. ([[Non-relation]])
        * The signifying structure is coextensive with a gap.
        * Lacan: implication of discursivity and gap = signifier of the lack in the other.
            * The signifying order emerges as already lacking one signifier, it appears with the lack of a signifier "built into it" (*lack of "binary signifier"*)
            * The signifying order begins not with One or multiplicity. It begins with a "minus one".
        * In the place of the gap, [[Enjoyment (jouissance)]] appears and stains the signifying structure: it is the heterogeneous element, enjoyment marks (curves) the signifying order by sticking to a certain set of signifiers that relate in some way to the lack of the signifier.
        * The way enjoyment relates to the signifying order passes through the negativity (minus one).
            * This negativity is the Real of the junction between the missing signifier and enjoyment;* this configuration is sexuality*.
    * Sexuality is not a being that exists beyond the symbolic: it exists as the contradiction of the symbolic space that appears because of the constitutively missing signifier and enjoyment that appears at its place.
    * Human sexuality is the placeholder of the missing signifier. It is a mess that compensates for the sexual relation as impossible (to be written).
        * Messiness is result of the attempt to invent a logic at the very point of the impasse of such logic.
    - *Formulas of sexuation *restate the issue of sexuality and "sexual relations" as a logical problem (problem of the signifying logic) out of which it springs.
* [[Copjec]]: sex is the impossibility of completing meaning, not ([[Butler]]:) a meaning that is incomplete. Language is structurally incomplete, not sex.
	* Concept of the Real is lost when sex → gender.
	* Genders are said to *be*, or to exist.
