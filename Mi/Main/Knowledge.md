[[Absolute knowledge]]

Two kinds of knowledge: what its made of (undermining) and what it does (overmining)[^1]
- Knowledge does not exhaust our cognition of an object.
	- Something unknowable remains, we can only hint at it.
	- Art: *Guernica* 

[[Aesthetic]] knowledge?[^1]
Getting at a thing indirectly: aesthetics (artist calls attention to the third object).
- Indirect forms of discourse, philosophy is not knowledge.
	- Philosophy is opposed to literalism.
- Metaphor 
	- Pseudodionysius: description of the holy trinity, a light with three sources, merging into one light.
	- Metaphor isn't reversible (the subject cannot switch)
		- metaphor cannot be too close or too far to being convincing (?) (pen is a pencil is not aesthetically pleasing mostly)
	- Non-literal connection.
