Modernity is not a summary concept.[^1]
- [[Marx]]: modern times began with abstract and general wealth
- The questÄ±on of the domain of the will belongs to modernity.

"Alternative modernity" critique of [[Jameson]]: 
- What if there could be alternative modernities?[^2]
	* Anybody can have his own modernity.
	* Historicist nominalism ("there is no modernity as such, only particular modernities")
	* Antagonism is reduced to a particularity
		* We already had alternate modernities (e.g. [[fascism]]). Didn't work.
- There is antagonism in the very universal notion of modernity.
    * Modernity as a notion names a deadlock, particular attempts are attempts to solve it.
    * Universality is the sight of antagonism ([[virtual]])
