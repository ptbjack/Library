Happens when something "stops not being written".[^1]
* Disjunction of the necessary and the impossible.
    * Repetition is a conjunction of the necessary and the impossible ("it does not stop not being written")
    * Disjunction affirms being in its contingency.
    * Love encounter
* Pessimism: contingency moves to necessity where it doesn't stop being written.
    * Badiou: fidelity is needed to avoid this.
    * "New signifier" could build something on the basis of a love encounter.
* Love encounter happens to us, involves surprise: "how surprising that you are you!"
    * [[Rosset]]: passion vs real love
        * Passion is morbid craving for an unreal (derealized) object.
            * Involves enjoyment not in the object of passion, but in the passionate dieting itself.
        * Real love wonders at the coincidence of the loved (desired) object with an existing object.
            * A split, minimal difference is also involved in the real object,
            * Split ad the coincidence appear at the same time.
* New signifier would be capable of naming, sustaining, the minimal difference (contingency) on account of which the lover reminds me of himself.
    * Minimal difference keeps impossibility from becoming necessity.
    * E.g. nickname in love relationship: name that provides a signifier of the very disjunction of love object and existing object in a concrete love relationship.

The turn to "real experience" diverts from the only way to touch something of the [[Real]], which is the right word.
* Word that name something about our reality for the first time, and hence make this something an object of the world, and of thought.
* Not a correct description of a reality; it introduces a new reality
    * E.g. [[class struggle]]
