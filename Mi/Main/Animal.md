Zero level of negativity is excessive stucking to something.[^1]
- Drive, compulsion to repeat
- Animals vs humans: animals move on, humans have fixation to impossible object.

Nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our Other) in the first place. Culture is not something that denatures, splits natural sexuality; it is being generated at the very locus where something in nature (as sexual nature) is lacking.[^3]
- Humans possess [[Unconscious Knowledge]], animals, don't.

Human animal based on double difference:[^4]
1. First, difference that differentiates one animal species from others.
    * Inclusive; humans have a properly differentiated place within the animal kingdom.
2. Human exception (human difference is different kind of difference), divide between ourselves as animals and ourselves as something else.
    * E.g. body/spirit, the distinction of the second term is testified to by its ability to ignore or even turn actively against the first term, which binds us to animality.

Animality in two ways:[^4]
* Figure of untamed excess: image of an unrestrained, excessive enjoyment.
* Figure of animality as lacking any (real) excess.
	* Modern figure 
	* Organic/symbolic system closed upon itself, unable to do something more than be an extension of "natural causality", not being ridden with some kind of excessive restlessness, [[Being-toward-death]] ([[Heidegger]]), jouissance ([[Lacan]]).
	* [[Kant]]: Pathological actions are those of the "human animal".
		* ==Ethical subject requires not only conforming to the moral law, but also the additional, excessive "only because of the law".
		- Human human" is on the side of the excess, including the excessiveness of the moral law itself, interrupting natural causality.
	- [[Nietzsche]]: the problem is that humans are not half animals and half something else, they are half animals, full stop. There is nothing but the animal part, even this part is not "whole", lacks something. The superstructure of humanity is generated as a disguise, as clothing for this lack, for this failure to be fully animal.
		* ==Man as a being the animal part of which is lacking something, and "humanity" as the dress to cover up this lack, missing part.==

[[Lacan]]: there is no animal, zero level of humanity ("human animal") The plus (what in human is more than animal) takes the place of the less (what in human is less than animal).[^4]
- Drive not completely separated from biological, organic needs, but cannot be simply reduced to them.
- [[Enjoyment (jouissance)]]: independency of the drives, which combines with different things, ideas and objects, satisfaction beyond need.

Animal sexuality:[^4]
* Where as animal sexuality is simply inconsistent, jouissance is something like a set containing this inconsistency as its only element.
 Humans are the question mark to the very notion of the animal as a consistent entity.
    ==* Humans are the living proof that the Animal doesn't exist.==
- [[Early Lacan vs Late Lacan]]

==The speaking being is neither part of nature, nor its exception, but its [[Real]]== (the point of its own impossibility, impasse).[^4]
* The "natural norm" is secondary to the "incomplete ontological constitution" of nature.
* But, the incomplete ontological constitution is not synonymous with chaos.
    * Nature is not chaotic, it is lawful, but this lawfulness is the very structuring of its own inner antagonism, contradiction, or "incompleteness".

[[Cündioğlu]]: Hegel: İnsanı hayvandan ayıran inançtır, insani edimdir.[^2]
- İnancın aşılması gerekir, ardından düşünce gelir (reddedilmesi değil).
