The distinguishing feature of Communism is the abolition of bourgeois (private) property, NOT all property.[^1]
- development of industry has already destroyed self-earned property (of petty artisan and small peasant)

Modern bourgeois form, property is based on **the antagonism of capital and wage-labor**:[^1]
- Capital is a social power: it can be set in motion only by the united action of all members of society.
	- When capital is converted into common property, it loses its class-character.
- Minimum wage is for the subsistence, bare existence of the laborer. We need not abolish this, only its miserable character.
- Private property is already done away with for nine-tenth of the population.
