- Lacan rejects the imperative nature of interpretation in favor of equivocity.[^1]
	* Criticizes a kind of practice which brings theory into play at the wrong point or in the wrong way.
	* One should not be using words that make sense only for the analyst.
	* Replaced the word "word" by the word "signifer"; it lends itself to equivocity, to several possible meanings.
Equivocity itself can function directly as a formula.
* "Before it starts" joke: the punchline evokes and uses multiplicity in order to efficiently pin down and transmit a singular point (or impasse).

Univocity is a characteristic of the symbols of [[animal]] language.
* Equivocity is the inherent condition of formalization, which is the formalization of the impasse/ "hole" through which meanings exist as bound together in a given configuration.
* Key (right word) works in dissociating structure, unlocks the form of unconscious itself.
* Formalization concerns the point of entanglement of speech (as sustaining the dimension of truth) with the Real.

Lacan tries to verbalize formulations - tying knots and throwing them at the audience.
* Similar to Beckett (to bore holes in language).
    * Equivocity and formulization are inseparable, Beckett and Lacan both use puns as "formulas".
