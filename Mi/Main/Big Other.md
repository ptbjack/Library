The Other guarantees the consistency of the field of [[Meaning]], knows everything except that it does not exist (that it is inconsistent)[^1]
* Singular ignorance enables the preposition that the Other knows
* And makes possible [[disavowal]]: “I know very well but I nevertheless do.”
* So, any change in our [[unconscious]] must be made in the Other.

Big Other no longer has any hold on us in the guise of a concrete, ‘small’ other.[^2]
* The Other is preserved as empty place
* The symbolic order appears as a playground within which we are free yet we are utterly powerless in relation to the crucial parameters of this socio-economic structure itself.
	* Radical [[foreclosure]] of the cause, of the object-cause, and [[freedom]].
	* Freedom becomes abstract ‘freedom of choice’
