Psychoanalysis and modern science share common ground of the Real in its absolute dimension, but they have different ways of pursuing this Real.[^1]
* Galieanism: modern notion of nature according to which nature is nothing other than the empirical object of science.
    * The revolution of Galilean science consists in producing its object("nature") as its own objective correlate.
* Modern science produces its object
    * Creates new real(ity): the object of science is not "mediated" by its formulas, it is indistinguishable from them, does not exist outside them, yet _*it is real (it has real consequences or consequences in the Real).*_
        * The new Real that emerges is a Real in which _discourse has consequences_. Shift of emphasis from a discursive study of the Real to the **consequences of discourse in the Real.**
		- [[materialism]]
	* The definition of the newly emerged reality
        * Modern science creates a new space of the Real (Real as a new dimension of "natural" space"): physics is added to nature, with nature continuing to stay where it has always been.
        * Nature keeps standing there as the Imaginary, as something irrelevant.

[[Realism]] in science:
* [[Lacan]]: science reduced 'nature' to a letter (reduction implies cut, substitution)
	* Not representation; the letter doesn't represent nature, but replaces it with something that belongs to discourse.

Scientific formula catches in its net a fragment of the thing that is in itself absolute.
* The Real is that portion of a substance that does not slip through the net of mathematizable science, but remains caught in it.

Science v psychoanalysis
* Lacan: science has no memory, it forgets a dimension of truth that psychoanalysis seriously puts to work.
    * No memory of that out of which emerges the objective status of its enunciations.
* Radical discontinuity at the core of every significant scientific breakthrough, establishes the absolute status of its objects; the *subject is the name of this discontinuity.*
