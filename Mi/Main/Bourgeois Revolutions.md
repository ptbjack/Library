Revolutions before 19th century:[^1]
- Bourgeoisie has put an end to imaginary relations between people; it resolved personal worth into exchange value.
- instead of numberless freedoms, only a single freedom of Free Trade, freedom to exploitation.
- Contrary to previous industrial classes, the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and with that, the whole of society.
