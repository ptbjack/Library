[[Levinas]] promotes repression to the rank of the highest ethical maxim.[^1]
* The Other demands our interpretation, and we are responsible for this interpretation.
* The Other is only a catalyst, the enigma is the point through which the subject refers to itself via the constitutive interval of interpretation.
- Close to the vicious circle of the superego
- Endless responsibility
	* Vs. Psychoanalysis: singular responsibility in relation to the singular object which is the decentered point through which the Other and its corresponding subjectivity are being maintained or not.
		* [[Causality]] through object

Freud's patient who says "It is not mother"; unconscious is in the censorship (form), not the content.[^2]
- Symptoms persist beyond becoming conscious of the repressed content.
* We cannot eliminate the structure of the gap that generates the repressed content.
	- Gap ===becomes visible through double negation as its "indivisible remainder"===: "it is not not-mother" is not the same as "it is mother.
	- "with without cream" is a trace of that which is not, the signifier has a spectral quality.
