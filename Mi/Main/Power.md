Oscar Wilde: "Everything is about sex except sex. Sex is about power."[^1]
* Sex is used for, and as, power.
* Power is the outcome of turning something in the other (e.g. their desire) against them.
**Power in its "purification" gets sexualized**: the very proving of one's point is for him the ultimate source of enjoyment. Certain subjectivation and exposure via desire can always be at stake in "sexual relations".
* Possible dimension of power.
* We risk to be, and sometimes are, hanged by the ropes of our own desire.

Power that comes from being in the position to seduce--- power is all about position of power, sex enters the game on a secondary level.[^1]
1. There are certain position which facilitate seduction and even automatically engender it.
	* Psychoanalysis, transference almost inevitable appears during the treatment.
	* Sex used for power.
2. Abuse of power in forcing, blackmailing people to cooperate with our sexual desires.
	* Power exists outside of sexuality, is used to get sex.
	* Power used for sex.
	* Sexuality as the hostage of power relations.
	* Abuse:
		* MeToo risks ideological operation where it is implicitly suggested that power is problematic ONLY where it involves sexuality.
		* It is problematic because someone ENJOYS it--- enjoyment constitutes the link to sexuality.
		* Non-professional abuse (someone enjoys it), we have no means of addressing professional abuse.
			* Jullian Assange: the allegations of sexual abuse are enough to block out the enormous systemic and systematic crimes and abuses revealed by WikiLeaks.
		* Sexual abuse functions as a welcome decoy: as a stain the elimination of which whitewashes other ways in which power operates, making them look normal ("professional").
* Mainstream focus on sexuality and sexual scandals is ALSO a symptom: there are significant dimension of power that we simply don't talk about and don't have the means to talk about.
    * We talk about sex in a way that allows for the concealment of systemic causes of violence in general, including those of sexual violence.
    * **For all the talk about sex and sexuality, nobody cares about IT. The talk is about power and whitewashing of power.**
    * Sex is overexploited yet not taken seriously in itself.

Sexuality functions today as the embodiment of the very visibility/subjectivity of [[violence]].[^1]
* "Sexual violence" has the capacity of absorbing/subjectivizing all layers of violence.
* If it is sexual, it cannot be but personal--- someone enjoying it, hence being personally corrupt.

Academic debates, shift from "politics" to "power":[^1]
* "Politics" can be judged right or wrong, even if there is no direct personal gain or abuse involved. Politics allows for discussion, controversy, rebellion, militancy.
* **"Power" can never be wrong, it can only be abused.**
    * Saying that it is always bad isn't saying much.
    * Criticism results in two divides, professionalism/abuse or benevolence/wickedness. These are all subjective and not social categories.
    * The bottom line of criticism of abuse/wickedness is that if we eliminate the abuser or cut out the corruption, everything will be well and sound again.
        * E.g. eliminating Trump, America will become great again.
