= Reality, real effects by something that does not fully exist.

[[ISR]]:[^1]
1. Imaginary virtual: we erase somethings of the person from the image we are interacting with. Image has reality, structures the way I am dealing with you.
2. Symbolic virtual:
- [[Authority]]; in order be exercised, has to remain virtual (threat). If direct, it is experienced as impotence.
* [[Belief]]; presupposed, nobody has to believe for belief to structure reality.
	* E.g. Christmas, Democracy
3. Real virtual:
	1. Imaginary real: traumatic images, too strong to be perceived.
	2. Symbolic real: quantum physics (resists symbolization). It works but resists consistent ontology. Functioning, meaningless machine.
	3. Real real:
		* Attractors in physics: the shape which doesn't exist in itself, an abstract form structuring elements around it.
		* Einstein, gravity and mass.
		- [[Trauma]] in [[Freud]]: 
		    * First, a dense presence of some real which intrudes into symbolic space and curves it.
		     * Then, traumatic scene is resuscitated when the curvature of the symbolic space (antagonism, imbalance) is confronted.
		- ==Politics: [[class struggle]] comes first (symbolic space is curved, imbalanced). In order to account for it, we invent the figure of the Jew.==
