[[Badiou]]: Lacan is wrong in thinking that we cannot speak about the Real and that there is no truth about the real.[^2]
* But, [[Lacan]]: we cannot speak about the Real because speech is too close to it, because it can never fully escape the Real, but holds onto it.
    * The Real is the inherent contradiction of speech.
* Paradox indicates that language cannot be neatly separated from the Real (the impossibility of saying it all).
* The place/position of truth is the point where speech "slips," "lapses" int the Real that it tries to articulate.
