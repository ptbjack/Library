Libido names the ‘energy’ involved in the processes of supplementary satisfaction. This means sexual, and sexual intercourse is properly sexual on account of being composed of different partial drives such as looking, touching, licking etc.[^1]
- Jung: ‘libido’ as psychic energy not solely sexual.
- Freud: libido designates original and irreducible unbalance of human nature due to supplementary satisfactions.
- Lacan, [[Lamella]], libido = loss
