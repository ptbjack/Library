Original nonexistence of any germ of two sexes during preadolescence.[^1]
- Auto-erotic activity of the erotogenic zones is the same in both sexes.
* Libido is invariably of a masculine nature, whether it occurs in men or in women and irrespectively of whether its object is a man or a woman.
    * Masculinity and Femininity are just ideals that exist nowhere in reality.
    * If pure Masculinity and pure Femininity existed, their sexuality would be one and the same ("masculine")

Sexual difference does not arise from there being two sexes or two sexualities, but from the fact that there is no "second sex", and from an enigmatic indifference of the "sexual thing" (polymorphically perverse autoeroticism) that appears at the point of the "missing sex".[^1]
* **What splits into two is the very nonexistence of the one (the one which would be the Other).**
	* What splits in two is the very "one that lacks", the minus, the with-without.
* **There is no subjectivity beyond (or simply outside) the sexual division.**
    * Sexual difference is not a secondary distinction of subjectivity, or simply culturally constructed.
- Sexual difference is a difference in configuring what makes all the difference: the minus marked by the phallic function (of castration).
	- Masculinity is a matter of **belief**, femininity is a matter of **pretense**

		- constitutive exception vs constitutive deception

* We have differentiality (two different signifiers), but there is nothing different in the realities to which they refer.[^1]
    * Not one reality, reality as split.
* Example of the presuppositions of the functioning of the signifier.
    * "Ladies and gentlemen" as example of the constitutive gap and contradiction at the core of the signifying logic.
* Train window, brother - sister example: they cannot agree where they are.
    * Sexual difference is the consequence of the the fact that something is lacking in the signifying order (at the same time, there is something excessive in it- [[Enjoyment (jouissance)]]).
    * Difference has no ground: there is no "two homelands", their homeland is one and the same: this oneness and sameness is the oneness and sameness of pure difference.
* Heteronomy is not that between Ladies and Gentlemen, but between language as a system of differences and the object-like surplus ([[objet a]]) appearing at the place of the constitutive minus of this system, spoiling its pure differentiality.
    * Sexual difference is difference in the configuration of this "spoiling".
