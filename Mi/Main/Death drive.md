What Freud introduces as "death drive" (*Todestrieb*) is not what Zupancic and other Lacanians mean by it.[^4]
* [[Freud]]: "instinct" to regain the supposed original homeostatic, tensionless state.
* [[Zizek]]: death drive is the most radical tendency to maintain a state of tension, to avoid final "relaxation" in obtaining a state of full homeostasis. Death drive is the insistence of an organism on endlessly repeating the state of tension.
* There is a logic from the first to the second on the ground of [[sex]]uality:
	* The middle of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle":
		* Death drive as primary (first instinct is that of returning to inanimate matter, all life aims for death)
		* Life instincts (conservative instincts) are forces that fortify the detours from this fundamental drive.
		    * Secondary formations in respect to life's primary drive, the death drive.
		* Death drive names a kind of fundamental or ontological fatigue of life as such, it is the steady undercurrent of life.
		* Life is accidental, there is no will anywhere that wants to live: what we see as "vital forces" are instincts constituted in the process of reiteration of the accident called life.
		* There is no struggle of two wills called life forces and death forces, life is a circuitous route to death, and conservative instincts are the pavement of this route, they are indistinguishable from it.
		* Instincts of self-preservation do not change life's fundamental goal, they simply introduce a *temporality* into it. Mode of this temporality is *repetition*.
		* Life is not the other of death, it is something that happens to the inanimate. It is interruption, a gap appearing in the inanimate.
		    * Life gives a **singular, separate form to an inherent gap** on account of which the inanimate does not simply coincide with itself.
		    * Not only that the inanimate universe is indifferent to life (materialist reproach to correlationist view of reality), we are mere perversions, strange pleasures, of the inanimate itself.
		        * Life is a nightmare of the inanimate.
		        * Death drive is an "objective affect" of life
	* The beginning of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle": (Original conception of) Death drive is not what goes on "beyond the pleasure principle".
		* *Pleasure principle* refers to seeking relief from tension, to the lowering of tension in an attempt to reach a homeostatic state.
		    * It is a mental equivalent of what Freud later calls the fundamental tendency of all life to return to the inanimate. 
		    * death drive = pleasure principle
		* *"Reality principle"* is like the detour of life instincts.
		* Sexual drives are in life more than life.
		* Dualistic view, opposition between Eros and Thanatos.
			* *Todestriebe* is fatigue as life's fundamental and objective affect
			* Sexual drives split with this logic, they are detours that make an actual difference, produce something "new", establish potential immortality (of the species).
			* ==Dualism of the drives is actually the other side of conceiving libido as a "neutral" desexualized substance (Jung).==
	- The end of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle": Monism of antagonism, contradiction, or split: there are only sexual drives (all drives are sexual).
		* Only sexual drives *drive* us in any meaningful sense of the word (to elsewhere than a return to an earlier homeostatic stage).
		* Vs. Fatigue, "magnetism of the inanimate".
		* With sexual drives, death is inherent to life, conditioning its perpetuation.
		    * Death of the individual is fundamental to sex (the survival of the species means that each individual is transitory and dies).

Freud (there are only sexual drives) → Lacan (every drive is virtually a death drive): death is what lurks in the midst of sexual drives as a negative magnitude or a minus implied in them.[^4]
* Death drive is repetition within repetition; repetition of some (partial) satisfaction accidentally produced within conservative repetition.
    * Surplus satisfaction/excitation that occurs in the course of the functioning and satisfaction of different organic functions.
    * Surplus is internal cause of tension, the drive originating in this surplus aims at repeating this tension.
    * Instead of satisfaction producing an appeasement of a surplus excitation, satisfaction generates further excitation.
* *Surplus satisfaction itself does not qualify as drive*:
    * [[Animal]]s also experience surplus satisfaction, yet for it to function as partial object, this satisfaction must start to function as objective embodiment of the negativity or gap involved in the signifying edifice of being.
* Death drive refers to an active split or declination within every drive, it is not one among the partial drives.
    * Split inherent to the drives as such, not the same as the split of the drive from organic functions.
    * Drive as purely disruptive pulsating negativity that gives partial surplus satisfactions their singular rhythm.
        * Like the difference between object a as marking a negativity as such and all forms of objects a, which are merely its representatives.
        * Double object a: it is a surplus satisfaction as sticking to the void, it is the void and its "crust". The real object of the drive is not simply surplus satisfaction but this negativity that "sticks" to it and is repeated by it.
        * Two splits:
            * First, split involved in the surplus satisfaction produced in the course of satisfying organic needs and function.
                * Repetition produces surplus, unexpected satisfaction, which becomes the drive of another repetition, repetition within repetition, repeating this satisfaction.
                * E.g. gluttony
                * Object-food, and there is also satisfaction as object.
            * Why can surplus satisfaction reverse the order of things?
                * The structure of the drive implies a negativity around which it circulates and which relates drive to the primal repression: inbuilt negativity -negativity transmitted with the "positive" ontological order of being.
                * If the drive wants us to repeat the surplus satisfaction, it is not because all it wants is to enjoy.
* **Drive does not want us to enjoy, [[superego]] wants us to enjoy and reduces the drive to the issue of satisfaction, actively blocking access to the negativity that drives it.**
    * Satisfaction (for the sake of satisfaction) is not the goal of the drive, but its means. 
    * **Death drive does not only want us to enjoy, it wants only to repeat this negativity, the gap in the order of being, even if this means to enjoy.**
    * Enjoyment is the means, the "aim" is the repetition of the lack of being in the very midst of being.

Lacan and Deleuze reject the primacy of the pleasure principle, and the possibility of relating the death drive to a homeostatic tendency.[^6]
* [[Deleuze]] affirms the primacy of the death drive.
    * Death drive is transcendental principle, pleasure principle is only psychological part of the logic of appearing of the death drive.
    * Death drive linked to [[repetition]], which is the place of original *affirmation*.
	    * Affirmation: selective, not a simple opposite of negativity.
* [[Lacan]]: "every drive is virtually a death drive"
    * [[Freud]]'s metaphysics is from [[Aristotle]]; lowering of tension is the ethics of Aristotle.
    * [[lamella]] - death drive to 'indestructible life'.


Drive is the impossible joint articulation of being and meaning in their heterogeneity.[^1]
- The being of the drive is lack-of-being.
- Drive is the being of the lack/void.

Embodies inner split of all satisfaction (possibility of supplemental satisfaction), [^2]
	* de-centering the subject and the Other:
		* Subject finds satisfaction through the detour of the Other.
			* Detour is irreducible (i.e. transference is inevitable illusion)

[[Lacan]]: drive finds its satisfaction without attaining its aim.[^3]
* Drive is not element but elementary form of the split that precedes the elements split in it.
* Object of drive is the gap itself as object.

Split entails the division between the mental and the physical and their possible articulation.
* E.g. [[Culture]], 
	* drive is short-circuit between them
	* Drive is intersection which is generative of both sides that overlap it.
		* Humans are many points where the difference between biology and the symbolic and themselves as defined by this difference are generated, the relationship between the who dimensions is being constantly negotiated (posited, repeated, solidified, defined, and redefined).
		* No ‘pure life’ or ‘pure symbolic’, paradoxical joint:
			* Autonomous field of the symbolic is produced at the periphery of movement generated by the intersection and retroactively affects its own point of generation.
	* Analysis stumbles against the subject of the drive that binds the self and the otherness in their very split.

Topology of the drive has two ways to understand:
* Standard reading: with humans the deviation from organic need is original, and it is this deviation as original that constitutes the human Difference, Exception.
* Radical reading: as a being of the drive, man is the point where nature's own inherent impossibility gets articulated as such.
    * "Human difference" is what testifies to the fact that its Other (the Animal) does not exist.

Double loop of the drive:[^4]
![[loop.png]]
* Death drive can eventually shift life's fundamental goal of returning to the inanimate.
    * Establishes the ways of returning to inorganic existence other than those which are immanent in the organism itself.
    * Death drive is what makes it possible for us to die differently.

[[Brassier]]: the separation of organic inside and inorganic outside is achieved at the price of the death of part of the primitive organism itself.[^5]
 * Death drive is the trace of the scission (primordial death): the scission cannot be bound because it remains the unbindable excess that makes binding possible.
* Third element, death, preconditions the opposition of life and death and is presupposed by it.
* "Life wants to return to the inanimate": life has nowhere to return to except that with the lack of which it has come to life.
* the excess of the death drive is the trace of the aboriginal [[trauma]] prior to experience, **[[repetition]] (of empirically traumatic experience) is a means of awakening anxiety in order to master and "bind" the excess.**
