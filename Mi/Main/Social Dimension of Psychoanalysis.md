[[Lacan]]: Psychoanalysis won’t ‘stay in its field of therapy’, it has intrinsically social, objective, and critical dimension. It is not about the individuals and their intimate problems- these are inscribed into the socio-symbolic field ‘Other’.[^1]

Psychoanalysis: today, you feel guilty if you cannot enjoy.[^2]
* Double function of psychoanalysis:
    * (1) Badiou: learn to become a pitiless censor of yourself. Opening up a space in which you are allowed not to enjoy.
    * (2) reinventing utopia: not exercise in free imagination.
        * Immediately enacted, when there is no other way.
        * Doing what appears impossible.
        * Practicing utopias.
