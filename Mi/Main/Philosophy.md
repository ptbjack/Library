Philosophy starts with uncertainty and not with certainty.[^1]
- NOT with Descartes' res cogitans (but more with his doubt?)
- Modern philosophy acts like geometry, proving disproving until irrefutable knowledge.
- Philosophy - *love* of wisdom, not S2 Knowledge
- [[Whitehead]]: philosophies are not refuted, they are abandoned (no longer seen coherent or adequate)
	- Parmenides was not adequate, "being is and non-being is not"
