[[Laplance]]: drive sexuality (le sexual) vs instinctual sexuality (le sexuel)[^1]
- Le sexual: related to partial drives and their satisfaction, not innate, not object-based, not procreative.
- Le sexuel: hormonally based, more or less preprogrammed. Arrives after puberty, after drive or infantile sexuality.
- What is acquired through the drives precedes what is innate and instinctual.

PROBLEM with Laplanche:
- It advances from the supposedly original, free, and chaotic multiplicity of the drive to a forced sexual unification.
- It puts the “humanly” sexual of sexuality on the side of the drives as opposed to reproductive sexuality.
- It missed the point of encounter between enjoyment involved in the drives and sexuality
- According to this narrative, adult sexuality practices are also in infantile sexuality, indicates the existence of some kind of continuity.
- Leaves out the [[unconscious]] (ontological negativity).
- According to this narrative, infantile enjoyment is sexual because it is contaminated with “enigmatic signifiers”, unconscious and sexually charged messages of adults.
