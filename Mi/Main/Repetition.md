What Hegel can't think: [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Freud]], non-productive repetition.[^1]
- In Hegel, there is always [[sublation]] repetition (passage from in-itself to for-itself). 
- [[Deleuze]]: because he cannot think of pure repetition, Hegel cannot think of the radically new.

[[Death drive]]:
 Split involved in the surplus satisfaction produced in the course of satisfying organic needs and function.
* Repetition produces surplus, unexpected satisfaction, which becomes the drive of another repetition, repetition within repetition, repeating this satisfaction.
    * E.g. gluttony
* Object-food, and there is also satisfaction as object.
