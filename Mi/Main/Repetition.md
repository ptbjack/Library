What Hegel can't think: [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Freud]], non-productive repetition.[^1]
- In Hegel, there is always [[sublation]] repetition (passage from in-itself to for-itself). 
- [[Deleuze]]: because he cannot think of pure repetition, Hegel cannot think of the radically new.
	- What drives repetition is not a failure, a lack. Repetition itself is both primary motivator and motor.[^4]
	* Repetition is singular negativity, and a site of affirmation. As original negativity, it is productive of what is there and what can be differentiated, compared, said to fail, etc.
		* Negativity becomes most positive force.

Compulsion to repeat some particularly traumatic incidents: why would somebody be compelled to repeat a distinctly unpleasant experience?[^2]
* Freud: repetition appears at the place of remembering; one repeats something one cannot remember. What the compulsion to repeat repeats is not some traumatic experience, but something which could never register as an experience to begin with.
* Repetition is effort to bind excess of excitation released by the [[trauma]]tic breaching of defenses 'beyond the pleasure principle' when the usual mechanisms of defense (including repression) no longer work.
    * [[Anxiety]] is still a defense
* [[Brassier]]: the excess of the death drive is the trace of the aboriginal [[trauma]] prior to experience, **repetition (of empirically traumatic experience) is a means of awakening anxiety in order to master and "bind" the excess.**

[[Death drive]]:[^3]
 Split involved in the surplus satisfaction produced in the course of satisfying organic needs and function.
* Repetition produces surplus, unexpected satisfaction, which becomes the drive of another repetition, repetition within repetition, repeating this satisfaction.
    * E.g. gluttony
* Object-food, and there is also satisfaction as object.

The excess of excitation does not exist independently of repetition, it exists in and through repetition itself.[^4]
* Split at the heart of repetition
* [[Deleuze]]: repetition is two-sided: it does not only repeat something (object), it also repeats difference as such (*pure difference*/[[Real]])
    * There is no first term which is repeated, there is no bare repetition which may be abstracted or inferred from the disguise itself.
    * Repetition is symbolic: symbols or simulacra are the letter of repetition itself.
    * Repetition as absolute beginning.
    * Reversal of Freud: **we do not repeat because we repress, we repress because we repeat.**
        * Two splits: the object of drive involves surplus satisfaction so it is different from the object of need. "Satisfaction as object" itself is a stand-in for a faceless negativity.
    * Pure difference is this negativity, most affirmative, productive "force".
    * *Crack (**felure**)*: fundamental, unifying negativity
        * Heredity is the crack (rift or the hole)
        * Central crack and instincts around it
        * [[Lacan]]: **each partial drive is a repetition of the crack, a repetition which constitutes this object as object.**

Deleuze vs Lacan:
* Common: what repeats itself is "*one-plus*": something plus the surplus that invests and drives it.
* Negativity → most positive force
    * [[Lacan]]: impossibility motivates repetition - non-being of what is to be repeated.
        * Enjoyment is the only "being", "substance" of that which is ontologically not, of the missing signifier.
        * Symptoms (signifying connections) are repetitions of original negativity, and its enjoyment-fueled representations related to the subject of the unconscious.
        * Fundamental negativity as a third element in relation to the unbound excess and the signifiers.
        * The production of a new signifier that puts an end to repetition.
	    * The separation within the repeating entity (One-plus) is not the centrifugal-selective force of the repetition itself, it is a third term: S1, a new signifier.
	    * The One that is repeated is a One-plus, bound by enjoyment.
	    * **Analysis produces a different, self-standing One: One as one alone. This One functions to give signifying support to the rift, the crack, implied by yet invisible in the deployment of differences and repeated with them.**
            * **The new signifier names the difference that makes all the difference(s).
                * **Does not replace the "hole", it produces it as something that can work as an emancipatory weapon.**
            * Enjoyment is the means of production of the signifier that eventually kills it off: the signifier interposes itself between the signifying enjoyment and the hole/gap at the place of which the latter appears.
	- Vs. Deleuze: the surplus is not in itself the real scene of emancipation, but the means of production of that which eventually realizes this emancipation: the tectonic shift does not take place at the level of this surplus, but thanks to the newly produced signifier.
		* The placing of the subject at the level of enjoyment in talking enables the production of the new signifier from the perspective of which it is now possible to effect a separation at the heart of the One-plus involved in repetition.
	        * New signifier is *event* proper and it triggers a new subjectivation.
	        * By itself, drive does not work against repression. One cannot simply count on it to make the "right" selection.
	        * Not a force, only a letter can disentangle what exists only in entangled form, and eventually change this form itself.
    * [[Deleuze]]: fundamental negativity is the pure movement of the unbound excess appearing with different signifying masks or "disguises"
        * Tripartite topology is collapsed into a double movement of a One.
        * Original negativity IS the positive, productive movement or force.
        * Plane of immanence: the same thing is both disguising and disguised.
        * Realized ontology: Difference: pure being qua being.
        * **Topological → dynamic:
            * **Topological non-coincidence of being and appearing is liquefied into Being as a pure movement of Difference.**
        * **There is no Real here, it is ontologized.**
        * the plus is identified as movement of absolute difference, the real of being.
        * The repetition of the One-plus, driven by the "plus", differentiates the two elements (one and plus) and throws out the One to the benefit of Being as singularity of a pure movement.
	* Repetition as inner differentiation of the Difference.
	* Difference is the only and the original being, at the same time it needs to be realized, repeated and separated from the metaphysical and dialectical encumbrance that constitutes the history of Being and of its thought.
	* **Ethics replaced politics, claiming to carry out the task of politics better than politics.** Deleuze: selection of difference based on repetition.
