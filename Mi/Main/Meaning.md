Supposition of meaning situates the object in the field of Other.[^1]
- The Other that has the object is the enigmatic Other, we are sure they have a meaning.
	* Supposition of meaning excludes the unconscious of the Other, the Other knows and is coherent.
	* The unconscious of the Other is 'sacrificed' in the constitution of the subject's own unconscious.

The Other guarantees the consistency of the field of meaning, knows everything except that it does not exist (that it is inconsistent)
* Singular ignorance enables the preposition that the Other knows
* And makes possible [[disavowal]]: “I know very well but I nevertheless do.”
* So, any change in our unconscious must be made in the Other.

[[Sex]]ual meaning is there to mask the reality of a more fundamental negativity at work in sexuality, to put up a screen that derives its efficacy from to the fact that it is itself a means of satisfaction -satisfaction through meaning [[Jouis-sense]], satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning.
