Anxiety pertaining to femininity as essentially a masquerade.[^1]
* Not a dread of being punished for stealing the father's property, but more fundamentally, the anxiety of literally *being nothing*.
	* "Do I exist at all?"
* The subject hinges on the mask, under the mask, there is nothing but sheer ontological anxiety.
* Lacan: this **radical ontological anxiety is the prerogative of subjectivity as such. Subject as such is feminine.**

Man believes that he is (exists), "male anxiety" usually stops at castration anxiety. Man is the subject who believes he is man. Masculinity is a question of belief based on, and sustained by, the repression of castration.[^1]
* "Am I that name?"
* When females are successful in "male" professions, we are relieved to conclude that they are not really women but "men" ("mannish", homosexual). Relieved from **the anxiety that behind these accomplishments there is no substantial subjectivity and that this could be a general state of things, masculinity being but a simulacrum of a substantial subjectivity.**
* The presence of such women threaten the repression of castration.
