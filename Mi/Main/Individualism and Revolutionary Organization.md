The influence of elements from the student milieu after 1968 allowed the reappearance of **individualism**:[^1]
- The working class doesn't give rise to revolutionary militants but to revolutionary organizations: there is no direct relationship between the militants and the class.
- Militants have no particular 'salvation' to gain in front of the class or history.
- The organisation is not the product of the needs of the militant.
- Both theoretical elaboration and realization of practical tasks are equally important, there is no hierarchy.
==- Spirit of careerism must be banished from the organisation as being opposed to **disinterested dedication**.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.[^2]
