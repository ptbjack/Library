[[Althusser]]: Marx and Freud, part of the very reality they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic.[^1]
- Social conflict, ‘neutral’ position is always and necessarily the position of the ruling class.
- The criterion of objectivity is not neutrality but the capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
	- Some positions dissimulate conflict, some reveal it. One can discover the essence of conflictual reality by occupying certain positions and not others in this very conflict.
	- The sexual is such a “position”, because of the singular form of contradiction that it forces us to see, to think, and to engage with.[^2]
- Their worst enemy is not direct opposition, but revisionism.
	- Needs to be neutralized through revision, touched upon something true and dangerous.

[[Luhmann]]: Marxism will not repeat itself because it happened. 
- Unscientific character of Marxism: If you tell people what situation they are in, they will react unexpectedly. If monkeys understood behavioral science, behavioral science would have a big problem. [^3]
- You don't need to show the truth of theory through using it, you have to force it.
