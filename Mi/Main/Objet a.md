Three elements in the same line:[^1]
* Surplus of distortion between the manifest and latent content
* Leftover of the conscious interpretation
- The drive
	* Embodies inner split of all satisfaction (possibility of supplemental satisfaction), 
	* de-centering the subject and the Other:
		* Subject finds satisfaction through the detour of the Other.
			* Detour is irreducible (i.e. transference is inevitable illusion)
Navel = Lacanian ‘object a’[^1]
* If the Other is the symbolic coordinates that structure our word and provide its vocabulary, object a is an effect of the Other.
* Object a is the point where the effect maintains an ‘open line’ with the symbolic structure that generates it so that the structure is dependent, ‘vulnerable’ to this object.
