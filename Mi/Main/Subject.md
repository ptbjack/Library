No ‘free subject’ that has [[Freedom]] as essential attribute.[^1]
* [[Lacan]]: subject is the effect of the structure, it is anything but free.
* Subject is the point of regularity, of structure, in which the structure breaks down or displays inner contradiction, negativity, contingency, interruption, or a lack of its own foundation.

Subject of the [[Unconscious]] is what emerges when he can choose only meaning between being and meaning.
- [[Forced Choice]]

Infinity:[^2]
- true infinity is that of subjective self-relating.
- Marx: ==[[capital]] is automatic subject ==(capital is both bad infinity and good infinity).
