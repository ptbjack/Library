No ‘free subject’ that has [[Freedom]] as essential attribute.[^1]
* [[@Jacques Lacan]]: subject is the effect of the structure, it is anything but free.
* Subject is the point of regularity, of structure, in which the structure breaks down or displays inner contradiction, negativity, contingency, interruption, or a lack of its own foundation.

Subject of the [[Unconscious]] is what emerges when he can choose only meaning between being and meaning.
- [[Forced Choice]]
