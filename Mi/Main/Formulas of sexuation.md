Formulas of sexuation are two ways in which the constitutive minus of the signifying order is inscribed in the order itself and dealt with.[^1]
* Phallic function (*ϕ* x) marks the constitutive minus of the symbolic order.
	* Universal function, prerogative of subjectivity as such, yet there is nothing sexually neutral about its operation, it always follows the logic of this or that (sexed) position, does not exist as a neutral foundation (zero level of subjectivity).
	* Phallus is not a differentiating feature, it is the signifier of the difference as such.

Like [[Kant]]'s [[antinomies of reason]]; difference or contradiction does not exists between the two sides or positions (as in difference between man and woman). The two positions are parallel configurations of a difference or contradiction of the signifying order itself, which they logically decline in different ways (each one producing the fundamental contradiction in its own way).[^1]

* Left side is masculine side
    * Posits that there exists One that is not castrated (has access to full enjoyment, e.g. the primordial Father, the Woman)
    * The exclusion of this One is the way in which the subject emerging on this side appropriates the minus involved in the signifying order.
        * The negative reference point is constitutive, permits everything else to be constituted as such, as a whole: all x are subject to the function of castration.
        * E.g. primordial father: the exception (the "killing") of the One frames the renunciation common to all.
    * **[[Castration]]: to give up what one never had, to transform the "minus one" which comes with the signifying order into something that we have renounced.**
	 * "Negative quantity" of the signifier, the lack of the signifier gets a signifier called *Phallus *(*ϕ*, master signifier, S1).
	 * Assuming castration by relying on the phallus, assuming the lack in the Other by repressing it.
    * Subject relies on *ϕ *and establishes a relation to the Other in the guise of the small *a* on the right-hand side of the formulas.
        * The One (cut out) provides the signifying frame, the "window of fantasy", through which the other can appear as desirable (as object-cause of desire).
        * Lacan: man never deals with anything by way of a partner but [[objet a]] inscribed on the other side of the bar.
            * E.g. *[[Rear Window]]*, fiancée is desirable only when she enters the frame of the window.
* Right side is feminine side.
    * Castration does not rely for the feminine subject on the exclusion (exception) of the non-castrated Other.
    * Castration does not allow for any exception.
    * Not all x are subject to castration. (we cannot speak of "all" women or, simply, of *the* woman)
    * Juncture of two claims:
        * Woman is the Other, in the most radical sense, in the sexual relationship.
        * [[There is no Other of the Other]].
            * If the woman is the Other of man, man is not the Other of woman.
            * The relationship to the Other is included in the Other, it is "part" of the Other.
    * Woman thinks of the Other as part of the rule, as included in the rule.
    * [[Not-all]]: the nonexistence of the Other is itself inscribed into the Other.
        * [[Unconscious knowledge]]
        * Barred Other is not simply lacking other, but the Other the inconsistency of which is inscribed in it, has a marker in it.
        * *S(Ⱥ): [[Woman's jouissance]]
    * Woman also has relation with the signifier of castration *ϕ: *since the woman has a relationship with *S(Ⱥ)*, she is redoubled, not-whole, since she can also have a relation with *ϕ.*
        * Relation with the signifier *ϕ *is that on which existence is founded for any speaking being.
        * Relation with *S(Ⱥ) *puts us on the path of "ex-sistence".
        * Woman is fully in the phallic function, but there is something else which comes with the position of being the Other in the sexual relation, this supplement (relation with *S(Ⱥ)*) makes her relation with *ϕ *different than in the case of a man.
            * Woman cannot rely on a constitutive exception, but relies on a constitutive *deception*.
            * Riviere: femininity as such is nothing but the susceptibility to wear femininity as a mask (to wear castration as a mask). There is no "true femininity" as opposed to femininity as masquerade.
            * The essence of femininity is to pretend to be a woman.
        * Castration is not repressed, neither is it assumed as something empirical.

* The phallic function is not masculine: what we perceive as "masculinity" and "femininity" are different ways of its deployment. "Putting it on" suggests femininity.

* "[[Feminine anxiety]]": anxiety pertaining to femininity as essentially a masquerade.
* **Masculinity is a matter of belief, femininity is a matter of pretense.**
