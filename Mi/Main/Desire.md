Desire is dialectical, cannot be reduced to its supposed last instance.[^1]
* We are split by our desire: if I don't want something and I say so, this "no" cannot be dismissed by pointing to the desire that perhaps nevertheless exists.
    * **Enjoyment**: I can be forced to enjoy what I don't want to enjoy.
    * This makes forcing more inexcusable.
* **Fantasy** is not subjective scenario waiting to be realized (rape fantasy). It participates in reality exactly as fantasy, fantasy as support of reality.
    * What prevents fantasy from being fulfilled is the fact that fantasy fully fulfills its role such as it is, as fantasy, as framework.
    * Being "realized" in its empirical content, it disappears, disintegrates as the frame that held our reality together.
        * Analysis does not realize the desire, makes it gradually useless as a frame for reality.
    * Fantasy of dying and my unfaithful lover being devastated by it;
        * Helps sustain the reality of my actual love life, not something that would constitute its future accomplishment.
        * Those who fantasize indeed feel guilty/responsible for what happens to them: telling the victim it's not their fault is not helpful if issues of desire and enjoyment are not tackled.
* To deny one's subjectivity ("it was a manipulation") is a strange way of "affirming" oneself.
    * Holding the other responsible for their actions should not have as its condition that I fully give up on my subjectivity (desire).
    * "Victim cannot be a subject": refugees appearing as subjects and not just as devastated victims pops up hostility.
        * In order for us to love our victims and help them, we need them to stay victims, and helpless.
        * **Parallax view** that the truth demands is to see in the same frame the other as the subject and the other as the victim.
