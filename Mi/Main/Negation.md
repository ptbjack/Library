Freud:[^1]
The content of a repressed image or idea can make its way into consciousness on condition that it is negated.
* Negation is already a lifting of the repression but not an acceptance of what is repressed.

Freud's negation is not[^2] 
- Classical logic (duality of P or not-P): principles of (1) noncontradiction and (2) excluded third.
- Intuitionist logic where the negation obeys noncontradiction but not the excluded third.
- Paraconsistent logic where negation obeys excluded middle but not noncontradiction.

In Freud's negation, the third term is included as the very point of the ontological impossibility of the third. What is included as an entity receives the logical impossibility on which the alternative mother/not-mother is based.[^2] 
- It is not that the impossible has become possible by being included (as in intuitionist logic).
- As included in reality, the impossible-real can only be a specter.

The "Not" is condition of the unconscious, **Grund**.[^2] 
- Constitution of reality, cut along the lines of appropriation (*Bejahung*) and "expulsion" (*AustoBung*)
	- split between in and out coincides with good and bad.
- Reality testing, loss of immediacy: pleasure is found-again-pleasure.
	- Repetition of pleasure existence of things, we refind objects to convince ourselves that it is still there.
- Twist of reality testing: the condition of the good and experiencing pleasure is in finding the object outside (in reality).
	- What has once been inside needs to be found outside.
	- The outside is subjectively mediated.
- The negation of "not-mother" allows for the symptomatic formulation, inscription of mother in reality.
- The question to be asked is what is in the mother herself that enables her repression (the point of impossibility that determines her in her structural reality).

[[Dolar]]: Freud's *Ver* are not clear negations:
- Verdrängung: repression but not quite (there is no pure repression, there is always the return of the repressed).
	- Urverdrängung: primal repression
- Verwerfung: foreclosure is repression without the return?
- Verschiebung: displacement
- Verdichtung: condensation
- Isolierung: taking something into account, fact loses symbolic efficiency when taken out of context.
	- China, Mao's crimes: saying it functions as a block to any further mention of it.
- Aufstoßung: I have to lose part of myself in order to draw the external line between me and not-me.[^3]
