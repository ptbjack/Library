Capitalism is insufficiently evolved to survive the technologies it spawns.[^1]
- Capitalism is irrational; fails to make rational use of the brilliant machines it engenders.
- The trick is to help speed up capital's development while resisting its tendency to steamroll over our human spirit.

How capitalism exploits the [[Non-relation]]:[^2]
* Starts off with two revolutionary ideas: "the economic Relation does not exist" and "the non-relation could be very profitable".
* [[Smith]]:
	* Non-relation is a fundamental state
	* What we find at the very core of the most selfish individual enjoyment is actually the Other.
		* MISTAKE: what we find at the core of this Other is a most "masturbatory self-enjoyment. Not only individuals never do what we think we are doing, the Other and its invisible hand also do not do only what they think they are doing.
		* The invisible hand of the market is always already the invisible handjob of the market, putting most of the wealth decidedly out of common reach.
- Everybody is living better than two centuries ago, yet the price of this modern economic higher Relation is that the differences between the rich and poor are exponentially greater, fed by the non-relation in its "higher" form.
* In order for the non-relation to be profitable, it has to be built into the very mode of production.
	* Marx: money → [[capital]]. What makes the products (labor power) also appears with them on the market as one of the products, objects for sale.
	* Capitalism exploits the point of negativity of the social order, capitalists are not "stealing" from the workers, they are employing them to make the negativity/entropy of the system work for them. They are making themselves enriched.

Labor power as commodity is the point that marks the constitutive negativity, gap, of this system: the point where one thing immediately falls into other (use value → source of value).
* Labor power has no use value, it leaps over to the source of value.
* =="The Worker does not exist."== What exists is the person whose work is sold and bought.
	* A Worker that existed would actually be a slave.
	* The **proletariat** is not simply one of the social classes, it names the point of the concrete constitutive negativity in capitalism. Not the sum of all workers, the concept names the symptomatic point of this system, its disavowed and exploited negativity.
