***Perversion***: forcing the other to subjectivize herself.[^1]
* "Extracting" a subjectivation, forcing the other to become fully subject (to "decide", consciously accept)
* **Sadist** pervert wants the other to split (subjectivize) herself in response to the surplus object he makes appear for her, and to supplement her lack by that same object.
    * Complet(ed) subject, complete Other.

Professionalism has been hijacked and taken in the direction of ***perversion***.[^1]
* Classical notion: not getting your personal preoccupations and views interfere with your job while taking full subjective responsibility for the objective outcome of your actions (objective responsibility).
* New notion cuts off any subjective dimension.
    * The professional is mere executor of higher forces, subjective dimension is reduced to just a possible source of trouble.
* **Subjective responsibility for objective outcomes â†’ Subjective explanation for what is objectively wrong.
* Professionalization of power via elimination of enjoyment doesn't work, since there is ***impersonal enjoyment***. Perverts know that systemic enjoyment exists and how to put it to personal use, but that doesn't make the enjoyment simply subjective in its origin.
