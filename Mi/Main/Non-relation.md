Non-relation is not the absence of relation, it is a real, the Real.[^1]
- The sexual relation of fantasy does not exist, the reality of partial drives and fleeting pleasures is not the ultimate raw reality, all there is.
- The lack of sexual relation is real in the sense that as lack of negativity, it is built into what is there, determining its logic and structure in an important way.
	- False opposition between full positivity of the drives and the negativity at work in sexuality.
- The fantasy and imperative of the relation comes from within the very structuring of the drives.

The ontologically stated non-relation is seen as the obstacle to the formation of any "successful" concrete, empirical relationship. Lacan's point is that it is only the inexistence of the relation that opens up the space for relationships and ties as we know them.[^2]
* Non-relation is the inherent logic of the relationships that are possible and existing.
* Biased by its constitutive negativity, this structure is always more or less than the sum of its elements.
* The impossible substance of enjoyment = [[objet a]], objective counterpart of the non-relation (non-relation as object).
* Object-disoriented ontology, ontology as "disoriented" by the object a.

The relation between [[Enjoyment (jouissance)]] and [[sex]]uality exposes the non-relation at the very heart of every relation.[^3]

Abolishing the non-relation: emancipatory projects of 'new order', attempting to force the non-relation out of the social equation.

Social relations of power- domination, exploitation, discrimination- are forms of **exploitation of the non-relation**.[^4]
- 'narratives of the Relation', present a given form of social antagonism as the ultimate Relation, supposedly protecting us from the utter Chaos of the non-relation and at the same time disavowing non-relation and appropriating it as the generic and productive point of social power. Actual, concrete exploitation is based on this appropriation of "privatization of the negative.
- [[Capitalism]]
	- "The Worker does not exist"
- Unifying sexuality: sexuality unifies the drives as the crack around which they circulate and to which they keep returning. **Normativity's aim is not to unify or "tame" the original heterogeneity of partial drives, but to obfuscate and exploit this founding crack and its "productivity".**[^5]
	* [[Lacan]]: "sexual identity" is a contradiction in terms.
	    * Copulation is out of place in human reality, to which it nevertheless provides sustenance with the fantasies by which that reality is constituted.
	* [[Deleuze]]: the "germen" (germ cells) is the crack, the very instance of *felure*.
* The co-existence of the symbolic structure and enjoyment is not historical, belongs to the very "leaking" ontology of symbolic order.[^6]
	* The "homologization" (in the form of a new way of counting) and consequent complicity between libidinal and symbolic is a historic occurrence or **"invention".**
