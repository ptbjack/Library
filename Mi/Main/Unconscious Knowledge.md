* known known: the fact that Saddam is president
* known unknown: how many weapons Saddam has we don't know
- unknown unknown: unexpected weapon of Saddam
* [[Zizek]] adds ==unknown known==: we don't know we know them.
	* [[unconscious]]

Fundamental lack of knowledge in nature; two ways of not knowing:[^2]
- Animals do not know that they do not know.
	- They are not simply not conscious of it, they are unconscious of it.
- The human animal knows that it doesn’t know.
	- It involves not knowing that we know… that we don’t know.
- Lacan: unconscious knowledge is a knowledge that does not know itself.
