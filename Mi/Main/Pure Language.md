**suprahistorical kinship of languages**: consists in the fact that a whole can only be attained by the totality of the languages' mutually complementary intentions.[^1]

**Pure language** only emerges when the intended object is encountered in relative independence, as in these two words.[^1]
- different modes of intention regarding an intended object complement each other.
- In translation: the original grows into a purer and higher linguistic sphere
	- translation points to predetermined, inaccessible domain where languages are reconciled and fulfilled.
	- essential kernel, more than a message, that which is not retranslatable: the element toward which the genuine translator's efforts are directed remains out of reach.
	- **Fragments of a vessel**: translation must fashion a counterpart to the original's mode of intention in its own language in order to make both of them recognizable as fragments of a greater language.
- **the kernel of pure language** (beyond the communicable) seeks to be represented and produced in the development of languages, it can either be symbolizing or symbolized.
- burdened with alien meaning in languages, only translation can unbind it from meaning and ***turn the symbolizing element into the symbolized itself***.
