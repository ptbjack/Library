[[Pure Language]]
[[Lalangue]]

Language is not a neutral medium of communication between subjects, but produces subjects by implicating them in its inherent antagonism, its own inherent contradiction and impossibility.[^1]
- Subjects are produced as a response to language's inherent limit and the unexpected plus appearing at this limit.
