[Unconscious]], fundamental negativity of sexuality as such, is banned in Christianity. [^1]
- What is being banned is not the Signifier of the sexual (or its Image), but the (unconscious) knowledge of the nonexistence of such a Signifier.
- Christ is valued for his body, the body is the means by which communion in his presence is incorporation -oral drive. Its content has nothing to do with copulation.
- Christianity doesn’t need copulation. Even the “purest” sort of procreative sexual copulation is connected with sin.
	- [[St Augustine]]: sexuality is not the original sin (disobedience when eating from the tree of knowledge), it is the punishment for it, locus of its perpetuation. It is problematic enough to be seen as a punishment, a curse.
- Pure enjoyment, “enjoyment for the sake of enjoyment,” is not banned. What is banned, or repressed, is its link to sexuality.

What did Adam and Eve get to know when they ate from the tree of knowledge?[^1]
- Signifying structure of knowledge as such, the gap of the unconscious.
- The gap distinguishes knowledge from information or data.
- They were transmitted the gap of the Urverdrangung as constitutive of knowledge.
- When they ate, the result was an affect; they found the sight of their naked bodies [[Shame]]ful.

Bible refers to sexual intercourse as “knowing the other”.[^1]
- “Knowing the other in the biblical sense” is to engage with the point in the Other were knowledge is lacking.
	- Sight of naked bodies is “shameful” because they fail to convey the sexual relation.
	- Sexuality on the level of the imaginary; we can only see bodies enjoying parts of other bodies.
