the real of the super-ego injunction to enjoy:[^1]
* Old ethics: moderation.
* New ethics: of limitless consumption, no moderation. The object in itself is deprived of danger (decaf coffee).
    * Tolerance of avoiding harassment, intolerance of coming too close.
    * Ulrich Beck: "Humanitarian militarism": wars for peace

Superego wants us to enjoy and reduces the drive to the issue of satisfaction, actively blocking access to the negativity that drives it ([[Death drive]]).[^2]

God in [[Breaking the Waves]]
