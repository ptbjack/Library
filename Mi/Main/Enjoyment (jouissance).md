Enjoyment and [[Repression]] mutually sustain each other[^2]
* Exists through and as the articulation of the non-relationship between subject and the Other.

Enjoyment is always-already social, linked to the Other: the Other guarantees the Repression that the enjoyment needs in order to emerge as enjoyment.[^1]
- The Other and enjoyment like matryoshka:[^3]
	* Enjoyment is "in" the Other, but when we look "in" the enjoyment, there is also the Other "in" it.
	* Also the non-relation between the subject and the Other.
	    * If enjoyment is what disturbs this relation, it does so by implicating, placing them one in the other, not by coming between them (holding them apart).
	* All enjoyment already presupposes the Other, regardless of whether we "get it" with the help of the "real other" (another person) or not.
	* There is no enjoyment without the Other, because all enjoyment originates at the place of the Other (as the locus of the signifiers).
	    * Innermost enjoyment can only occur at that "extimate" place.
	    * Radical heterogeneity, antagonism between the signifier and enjoyment is not due to their heterogeneous origins, but to the fact that they originate at the same place.
	    * ==The Other is both the locus of the signifier and the locus of enjoyment.==

Jouissance names something particularly human, it is a singularization of a general inconsistency at work in animal life. 
* Where as animal sexuality is simply inconsistent, jouissance is something like a set containing this inconsistency as its only element.
* Singling out occurs with the signifier and its logic.
* Humans are the question mark to the very notion of the animal as a consistent entity.
    * Humans are the living proof that the Animal doesn't exist.

Badiou does not connect "wandering excess" to surplus-enjoyment. For him, enjoyment is irrelevant.[^4]
* Lacan: enjoyment is not irrelevant, it takes place at the point where something is lacking in the discursive.
