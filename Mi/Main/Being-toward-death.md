Heidegger's being-toward-death[^1]
* Status of death: opens up the metaphysical dimension proper.
* The space for the specific "immortality" in which human beings can eventually participate is opened up by man's unique relationship to his finitude and the possibility of death.
* Immortality is based on the specific mode of human finitude.

Lacan: the structural place occupied by death in Heidegger is the real of [[Enjoyment (jouissance)]].[^1]
 * Death as such does not involve the possibility of a "dramatic" relationship to itself; this relationship becomes "dramatic" only when *jouissance* intervenes.
    * Enjoyment as "a disturbing relationship to one's body" refers to the fact that by contaminating the satisfaction of all the body's basic needs, enjoyment introduces in the supposed immediacy of living_ a crucial gap_, on account of which things can take a different course than what is supposed to be normal or natural.
        * Enjoyment fundamentally modifies the nature of natural need, _deviations are man's nature_. 
    * Surplus-enjoyment is not transgression.
    * Enjoyment is suspended in sleep
        * Dreamwork, smuggling enjoyment into a dream, which eventually disturbs us.
    * [[Death drive]] - undead, life is not declination from death. If it is, there is further declination from declination: the declination of life from life produces the "death drive" as something undead that haunts both life and death.
