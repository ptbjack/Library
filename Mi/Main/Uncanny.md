[[Schelling]]: the uncanny is “everything that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light”.[^1]

Uncanny is when the explicit knowledge deposited in the Other no longer supports our reality, when the subject is alone in seeing that there is something wrong with what is happening with no Other to support her knowledge.[^1]

[[Lacan]]: uncanny, “the lack comes to lack”, surplus object emerges in its place, has no place in given reality.
* The lack comes to lack in [[objet a]], anxiety implies a certainty bound to this object.
* Eyes being plucked out
	* Instead of eyes, two empty holes in the person’s face
		* The holes are all too shallow, all too finite, their bottom all too visible and close.
		* The moment when the lack loses its symbolic or/and imaginary support, it becomes ‘a mere hole,’ an object. It is a nothing that remains there to be seen.
	* Eyes themselves appear as ghastly, impossible objects
		* ‘Openings into the soul’ → surplus ‘abject’
* [[Castration]] complex functions as the pivotal point of our experience because it provided a symbolic rendering, support, a way of dealing with the ‘lack in the real’.
	* [[Anxiety]] involves the menace of losing the castration itself.
		* Ghastly objects dislodge the object of desire and make appear the cause of desire.
