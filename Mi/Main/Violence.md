Difference between subjective and systemic violence:[^1]
* **Subjective violence** is experienced as such against the background of a non-violent zero level.
    * As a perturbation of the "normal" state of things.
* **Objective violence** is the violence inherent to this "normal" state of things.
    * Has to be taken into account to make sense of "irrational" explosions of subjective violence.
    * Systemic violence is perceived as business as usual, when a serious revolt appears on the side of the people, the issue is recognized and its causes attributed to the subjectively corrupt usurpation of the systemic dimension of power, to its **abuse**.
