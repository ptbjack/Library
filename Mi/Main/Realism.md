Realism: there is a reality outside of any relation.[^1]
- True realist talks about object-object relations.
	- Human-object relation is another object-object relation.
- Translation goes on in any relation, all objects are limited to their respective phenomenal worlds.
	- e.g. fire burning cotton, they don't interact with all of each other's properties.

[[Meillassoux]] (*Apres la finitude*): post-Cartesian philosophy rejected the possibility for us to have any access to being outside of its correlation to thinking.[^2]
* We are never dealing with an object in itself.
* There is no subject that is not always-already in a relationship with an object.
* The relation precedes any object or subject, the relation is prior to the terms it relates.
* All contemporary philosophies are variations on philosophies of *correlation*.
* The "co" is the grammatical particle that dominates modern philosophy, its veritable "chemical formula".
- Meillassoux: reduces the gap by preserving a certain gap between being and its mathematization.
* Realism of the correlate of the universals, or, the referent. (statement is ideal, the referent is real)

"The great Outside" is a fantasy, a screen that conceals the fact that the discursive reality is itself leaking, contradictory, and entangled with the Real, as its irreducible other side.
* The great Outside is the fantasy that conceals the [[Real]] that is already right here.
* [[Non-relation]]

Meillassoux: the joint articulation of the real and the discursive. ("speculative" realism)
* Possible mathematization of primary qualities
* The absolute necessity of the contingent
