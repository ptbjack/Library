Realism: there is a reality outside of any relation.[^1]
- True realist talks about object-object relations.
	- Human-object relation is another object-object relation.
- Translation goes on in any relation, all objects are limited to their respective phenomenal worlds.
	- e.g. fire burning cotton, they don't interact with all of each other's properties.

[[Meillassoux]] (*Apres la finitude*): post-Cartesian philosophy rejected the possibility for us to have any access to being outside of its correlation to thinking.[^2]
* We are never dealing with an object in itself.
* There is no subject that is not always-already in a relationship with an object.
* The relation precedes any object or subject, the relation is prior to the terms it relates.
* All contemporary philosophies are variations on philosophies of *correlation*.
* The "co" is the grammatical particle that dominates modern philosophy, its veritable "chemical formula".
- Meillassoux: reduces the gap by preserving a certain gap between being and its mathematization.
* Realism of the correlate of the universals, or, the referent. (statement is ideal, the referent is real)

"The great Outside" is a fantasy, a screen that conceals the fact that the discursive reality is itself leaking, contradictory, and entangled with the Real, as its irreducible other side.
* The great Outside is the fantasy that conceals the [[Real]] that is already right here.
* [[Non-relation]]

Meillassoux: the joint articulation of the real and the discursive. ("speculative" realism)
* Possible mathematization of primary qualities
* The absolute necessity of the contingent

Deleuze: realism implies radical desubjectivation, Lacan: subjectivation is the instance of an irreducible Real.[^3]
- New materialisms follow Deleuze and try to escape the transcendental cage, getting out of the subject.
* Lacan: if language was consistent ontological category, there would be no subject.
* Materialism as realism: exposes the brute reality, the material truth or basis of things that seem to stand on their own.
    * The reality minus the illusion which accompanies it and keeps transforming it into something quite different.
    * Sublime vs gruesome: realism is on the side of gruesome.
        * 1. the sobering effect of realist materialism points to a gap in realism itself: Reality "as such" appears as gruesome, it has to be perceived as more than it is: to be invested with subjective affect -repugnance, aversion, etc.
            * In order to get to reality, a surplus is needed (or produced), a surplus which is not reducible to reality such as it is.
        * 2. Opposition between "naked" reality and always-already subjectivized reality is false, not genuinely "materialist".
    * If reality appears with an irreducible excess "over" itself, this excess indicates a split or contradiction in this reality itself.
    * There is a reality that exists independently of the subject, the subject is precisely that which gives us access to reality independent of the subject.
    * Lacan's [[materialism]]: the subject is the objective embodiment of reality's contradiction. The subjective position is not only a concrete and singular way in which things determine me, it is also the subjectivation of a paradox.
        * The subject is situated at the juncture of the epistemological and ontological levels in the form of their joint negativity (lack of knowledge falls into a lack of being)
        * Materialism is thinking which advances as thinking of contradictions.
