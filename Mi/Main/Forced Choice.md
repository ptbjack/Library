Forced choice in psychoanalysis: The choice, supposed to imply a certain freedom, is that through which the subject emerges as subjected to the symbolic order and determined by it.[^1]
* “Freedom or death”; only way to choose freedom is to choose death and show that you have freedom of choice.

Subject of the unconscious is what emerges when he can choose only meaning between being and meaning.
* [[Repression]] of the first representation that eludes interpretation only possible against the background of forced choice.
