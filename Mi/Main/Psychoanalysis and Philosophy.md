Sexuality is the sine qua non of any true psychoanalytic stance.[^1]
- Treating it as secondary produces ‘psychologized philosophy’.
- Freud and Lacan are unshaken about sexuality being primary, and influence philosophy.
- Sexuality is ‘missed encounter’ that only allows for any true encounter between philosophy and psychoanalysis in their heterogeneity.
- Sexuality allows for universal theory of the subject that is the singular, concretely-universal point of its inherent contradiction.[^2]

Freud's essay ([[Negation (Verneinung)]]) is "birth of thinking out of the spirit of negation", quilting point between philosophy and psychoanalysis.[^3]
- A way of thinking of the singular and paradoxical negativity.
