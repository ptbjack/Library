# Early:

The presence of the signifier induces irredeemable loss on the part of the human animal: once it is articulated in the signifier as "demand", need is irreversibly alienated.[^1]
* The presence of the signifier deviates man's need: when subjected to demand, needs come back to him in an alienated form.
- What is alienated in needs constitutes *primal repression*, as it cannot be articulated in demand. Nevertheless appears in an offshoot:* desire*.
* Phallus designates "meaning effects as a whole".

Animal exists, the key fits into keyhole[^2]

# Late: 

The signifying order is coextensive with a lack.[^1]
* There is no another side of the signifier (pure organic need), it has a reverse side.
* The minus is the foundation (of the One of the signifying order).
* Change in mythology.
    * Nature is not interrupted with the emergence of the signifier.
    * Human story begins with the emergence of the signifier, one signifier "gone missing".
        * Speech is already a response to the missing signifier, which is not (there).
        * The condition of speech is  "one-signifier-less".
* Signifying structure emerges with-without one signifier, this "hole" has consequences and determines what gets structures around it.
* Coffee without cream/without milk joke: the waiter's response introduces paradoxical spectral entity in the very dimension of negativity.
    * "Without" = "with the lack of"
* Closer to Hegel  than early period of Lacan.
* Closer to Freud than early period of Lacan.
    * Freud: the "human deviation" starts with a surplus-enjoyment, there not being a natural need pure, devoid of surplus element which splits it from within.
    * Lacan complements Freud with the theory of the lack of one signifier as the other side of the surplus-enjoyment which pertains to the satisfaction of all our needs.
* **Primal repression belongs to the signifying structure itself, it appears as "one with" the originally missing signifier, as synonymously with the structure with-without.**

The supposed animal model of perfectly bi-univocal reproductive complementarity is a side effect of the "fantasy of the soul" through which we imaginarily "observe" the animal.[^2]
