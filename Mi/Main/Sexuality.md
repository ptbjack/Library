[[Psychoanalysis and Philosophy]]

[[Freud]]: sexuality is a paradox-ridden deviation from a norm that does not exist.[^1]
- Aberrant’ mechanisms (deviation from object, reproductive aim) are also present in what is considered to be ‘natural’ sexual behavior.
- Drives are partial, aimless, and independent of their object to start with. They do not become such due to some ulterior deviation.
- There is no ‘natural’ or pre-established place of human sexuality, it is constitutively out-of-place.
	- No substance to be properly described and circumscribed, it is the very impossibility of its own circumscription or delimitation.
	- [[Lacan]]: the Sexual does not exist, there is only the sexual that insists/persists as a constitutive imbalance of the human being.
 
 All satisfaction of a need allows for another satisfaction to occur, which tends to become independent and self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself. There is no pure natural need devoid of this surplus element which splits it from within.[^1]
- This split is the site of grounding of human sexuality.

‘The sexual’ as the psychoanalytic name for the inconsistency of being.
- The sexual is the edge of meaning, inner limit; the point of consistency of being that induces production of meaning.
- Sexual meanings revealed in therapy mask the reality of [[Drive]], it is a means of satisfaction through meaning [[Jouis-sense]], satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. Psychoanalysis tries to deactivate the path of this satisfaction, to make it useless.
- [[Heidegger]]: being-towards-death → [[Lacan]]: being-towards-sex.[^2]

The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.
- “For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- [[Sublimation]]
