Analysis relies on double presupposition:[^1]
* The object can be found in the unconscious formation
* Something can be changed/shifted through it

Work of analysis is separating the answer from the Other, subject realizes that the answer lies as an indivisible remainder of his actions in relation to the Other.[^1]
- de-interpretation[^2]
- synthesis is always on the side of [[Repression]]
	- Free associations disintegrate coherent story, take elements in divergent directions, introduce new elements etc. 
	* Against symbolism (“symptoms have meaning”)

Analysis stumbles against the subject of the [[Drive]] that binds the self and the otherness in their very split.

The end of analysis would be abandoning the thing in itself while preserving the gap that separates IT from the phenomenal reality, articulating this gap as a function of an immanent transcendence.[^3]
- [[Constitution of Reality]]
