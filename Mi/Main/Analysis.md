[[Speech in analysis]]

Analysis relies on double presupposition:[^1]
* The object can be found in the unconscious formation
* Something can be changed/shifted through it

Work of analysis is separating the answer from the Other, subject realizes that the answer lies as an indivisible remainder of his actions in relation to the Other.[^1]
- de-interpretation[^2] : The symptom is a subjective solution to some contradiction or impasse.[^5]
- synthesis is always on the side of [[Repression]]
	- Free associations disintegrate coherent story, take elements in divergent directions, introduce new elements etc. 
	* Against symbolism (“symptoms have meaning”)

Analysis stumbles against the subject of the [[Drive]] that binds the self and the otherness in their very split.

The end of analysis would be abandoning the thing in itself while preserving the gap that separates IT from the phenomenal reality, articulating this gap as a function of an immanent transcendence.[^3]
- [[Ontology]]

Psychoanalysis: today, you feel guilty if you cannot enjoy.[^4]
* Double function of psychoanalysis:
    * (1) Badiou: learn to become a pitiless censor of yourself. Opening up a space in which you are allowed not to enjoy.
    * (2) reinventing utopia: not exercise in free imagination.
        * Immediately enacted, when there is no other way.
        * Doing what appears impossible.
        * Practicing utopias.

[[Univocity vs equivocity]]:
- "I borrow my interventions from the analyst".
	* Hegel: philosophical proceeding which concerns itself only with aims and results, is already beyond the thing, is not involved with it. This kind of knowing is preoccupied with itself.
	* Only the analysand (unconscious) can produce the "right word." The analyst should be able to recognize it.
* **The right (equivocal) word "bores a hole" because it repeats/names the enjoyment that holds different meanings together in a symptomatic way.**
