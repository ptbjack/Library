Early [[Marx]] materialism vs idealism. 20th Century socialists take this dicothomy and disregard of metaphysics. Naive materialism is not going shopping too much.[^1]

Materialist intersubjectivity is inter-objectivity.
- e.g. Eisenstein and Joyce meet in Paris to discuss Kapital as film. Romanticism about how Joyce is blind as Homer and what they said to each other in this special point in history is wrong. Their material (Eisenstein's films and Joyce's novels) have more to say to each other than the people.[^1]
