Early [[Marx]] materialism vs idealism. 20th Century socialists take this dicothomy and disregard of metaphysics. Naive materialism is not going shopping too much.[^1]

Materialist intersubjectivity is inter-objectivity.
- e.g. Eisenstein and Joyce meet in Paris to discuss Kapital as film. Romanticism about how Joyce is blind as Homer and what they said to each other in this special point in history is wrong. Their material (Eisenstein's films and Joyce's novels) have more to say to each other than the people.[^1]

True materialism can only be dialectical materialism, grounded in the notion of conflict or contradiction, of split, of the "parallax of the Real" produced in it.[^2]
* The fundamental axiom of materialism is not "matter is all" but relates to the primacy of a cut.

Lacan's [[materialism]]: the subject is the objective embodiment of reality's contradiction. The subjective position is not only a concrete and singular way in which things determine me, it is also the subjectivation of a paradox.[^3]
 * The subject is situated at the juncture of the epistemological and ontological levels in the form of their joint negativity (lack of knowledge falls into a lack of being)
 * Materialism is thinking which advances as thinking of contradictions.
