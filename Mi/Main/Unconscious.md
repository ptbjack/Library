The unconscious is not a subjective distortion of the objective world, it is an indication of a fundamental inconsistency of the objective world itself, which allows for and generates its own distortions.[^1]

**‘Unconscious is outside’**: constitutive gap in the Other is the condition of possibility of the subject’s ‘own’ repressions.[^1]
- Repression fills in the gaps of (objective) reality.
- Subjective distortions are distortions at the place of something that is not.

Constitution of the unconscious as the refuse of interpretations of [[Enigmatic Messages]] (left out, repressed)?
* Leftover is not identified with unconscious, unconscious is already an interpretation.
* Unconscious is the interpretation which strives to incorporate this object (leftover) into its narrative. It interprets with respect to the leftover.
* Unconscious it that which continues to interpret after the conscious interpretation is done.
	* Interprets the relationship between the given interpretation and its leftover from the point of view of the leftover.
	* It’s interpretation is inscribed in the dimension of truth.

Any change in our unconscious must be made in the Other since the Other guarantees the consistency of the field of [[Meaning]].
The unconscious of the Other is 'sacrificed' in the constitution of the subject's own unconscious.[^2]

Third dimension of the unconscious. Lacan: the status of the unconscious is not ontical but ethical.[^3]
		- Ontically, it is elusive. It is not an alternative reality into which we could translate the slips and symptoms of our reality.
		- We circumscribe it in a temporal structure.
