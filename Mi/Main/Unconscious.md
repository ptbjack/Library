The unconscious is not a subjective distortion of the objective world, it is an indication of a fundamental inconsistency of the objective world itself, which allows for and generates its own distortions.[^1]
- Unconscious is the form of existence of an ontological negativity pertaining to sexuality (“there is no sexual relation”).[^7]

**‘Unconscious is outside’**: constitutive gap in the Other is the condition of possibility of the subject’s ‘own’ repressions.[^1]
- Repression fills in the gaps of (objective) reality.
- Subjective distortions are distortions at the place of something that is not.
- Unconscious comes to us from the outside: The unconscious starts with [[repression]] as the signifying form pertaining to discursivity as such.[^6]

Constitution of the unconscious as the refuse of interpretations of [[Enigmatic Messages]] (left out, repressed)?
* Leftover is not identified with unconscious, unconscious is already an interpretation.
* Unconscious is the interpretation which strives to incorporate this object (leftover) into its narrative. It interprets with respect to the leftover.
* Unconscious it that which continues to interpret after the conscious interpretation is done.
	* Interprets the relationship between the given interpretation and its leftover from the point of view of the leftover.
	* It’s interpretation is inscribed in the dimension of truth.

Any change in our unconscious must be made in the Other since the Other guarantees the consistency of the field of [[Meaning]].
The unconscious of the Other is 'sacrificed' in the constitution of the subject's own unconscious.[^2]

Third dimension of the unconscious. Lacan: the status of the unconscious is not ontic but ethical.[^3]
- Ontically, it is elusive. It is not an alternative reality into which we could translate the slips and symptoms of our reality.
- We circumscribe it in a temporal structure.
- Third object is neither positive or negative ([[Kant]] - transcendental object is an empty form (x));[^5]
	- [[Popper]]'s theory of falsification-- science as moving away from a current theory.
	- [[Darwin]] - moving away, evolution is shocking because humans are not the end-goal.

[[Hegel]] vs [[Freud]]:[^4]
- Hegel: Sense perception, "Now": unconscious is the universal form opposed to the particular content of my conscious thought. (You don't see the formal aspect i.e. the inner necessity of the passage from one figure of consciousness to the other)
- Freud, particular lateral connections, associations.
	- Form: pregnant woman's ambiguous dream signals that the father of the baby is unclear.
