[[Laplanche]]: material cause that cannot be reduced to empirical event.[^1]
* Third material reality of the enigmatic message.
* Enigmatic message not only so for the receiver but also for the sender.

Three elements:
* Subjective figure related to the formations of the unconscious
* Two causes:
	* Elements of ‘enigmatic messages’ circulating in the Other (words, gestures, gazes etc.)
	* Object-like surplus/leftover of the interpretation of these messages
		* Problematic relationship of this object with interpreting subject: something does not add up in the relationship between the subject and the Other, between the subject’s being and meaning.
		* It relates the subject and the Other in their heterogeneity, the inexistence of their common denominator.
‘Enigmatic message’ suggests mystery of meaning ([[que vuoi?]]), which involves presupposition that the other knows.
* Enigmatic message = encounter with inconsistent reality + presupposition of meaning (Subject must have had already ‘chosen’ meaning)
* [[Forced Choice]] of meaning
	* Enigma is secondary to forced choice
