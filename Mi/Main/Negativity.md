[[Zizek]]: The core of Hegelian negativity is in Kierkegaard and Freud, but the question has to be a Hegelian one.[^1]

Badiou has no strong concept of negativity at the level of being: Being deploys itself as pure excess over itself.[^2]
* Pure being is inconsistent, but not ridden with any impossibility. Impossibility originates in its representation (prohibition of the Event).
Lacan: pure excess is already a result of a minus-one, the gap that appears together with discourse.
* Subject is not only an effect of language, but of its breaking down, of its discontinuity.
* Event is possible because of the impossibilty inherent to being.
