[[Freud]]: jokes work with resistances, circumventing them with unexpected pleasure.
- **sublimation**: satisfaction of drives without repression taking place. comedy and philosophy can function as **gay science**.[^1]

Comedy as a social form that allows for dealing with impulses/ideas we don't want to think about and repress:
- an enjoyable collective-forming practice.[^1]

Comedy points to the irreducible materiality of nothing.[^3]
* E.g. coffee without milk joke
	* ‘Cream’ appears in its spectral dimension, deprived of its symbolic standing but insisting in the real.
	* Lack hanging on to partial objects
* Not symbolic rendering of nothing (‘nothing appearing as something, e.g. 0), remainder of nothing, insisting in the real, while being deprived of its symbolic support.
* Verbal comedy, spectral object seen when figures of speech are taken literally (ignoring the gap that makes them symbolic) or treating ‘immaterial’ things as objects.
	* E.g. Marx brother, ‘try my patience’
		* Elimination of gap that separates mental and physical objects, gap normally serves as a negative condition of ‘making sense’, appears now as substantial.

[[Comedy and the Uncanny]]

Comical, [^3]
* Feeling of reassurance that the Other is still guaranteeing the reality outside fiction, supporting the constitutive division between reality and the real.
* Funny vs comical: funny when the ‘reality-self’ of the actor displays a lack in the edifice of representation.
	* Comical is when the frame delimiting the space of ‘fiction’ appears within its own scope in the form of the comic object.
		* Simultaneous appearance of the Other and the [[Objet a]] on the same level is a comic scene par excellence.
* The object of comedy is not the sneeze, but that space or zone that simultaneously separates and links the sneezing and its body, the voice and its source, the smile and its face, etc.

## Stand up comedy vs sit down comedy 
difference is what they do with individual/social repressions [^1]
- **sit back comedy** consolidates and cashes in on our repressions.
	- irony as drawing the line between us who get it and the others who don't get it. Establishes place of the stupid other.
	- you can never be on the wrong side, so you enjoy being right (mainstream left)
- **stand up comedy**; attempting to win the audience, raking risk and convincing.
	- makes the audience stand up in their heads

## Good comedy
- Who is America,  Sacha Baron Cohen building a mosque in Arizona[^2]
	- liberal blackmail: freedom of choice between green A and blue A
	- keep dreaming alternatives within the choice I impose upon you
	- 'there is no dream mosque' as a response to systemic blackmail [^1]
