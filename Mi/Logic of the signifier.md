[[Saussure]]: S/s (signifier over signified).[^1]
* Emphasis on pure differentiality. Saussure: in language there are only differences without positive terms, signifiers "make sense", produce meaning, only as parts of differential networks of places, binary oppositions, etc.
* Emphasis on the arbitrariness of the sign: the signifying chain is separated from the signified, which is what the par in the Saussurean algorithm indicates.
 * [[Lacan]]: algorithm sustains the illusion that the signifier serves the function of representing the signified, it has to justify its existence in terms of some signification.

Erroneous conception: the signifier "tree" serves to represent some signification.
* It is not enough to assert that there is no connection between the two levels (would remain the enigmatic sign of a total mystery)

Lacan: the signifier "enters the signified", the bar between them does not exactly prevent that.
- [[With-without]]: the signifier does not represent a signified, nor is it simply "an enigmatic sign of a total mystery", it is with-without the signified (as the [[binary signifier]]).
- The lack of the relation (bar between the two levels) is inherent to the signifier (and the signifying order) as such.
	- [[Non-relation]]
* Binding negativity: "a signifier represents the subject for another signifier".
* With-out is the formula of the unconscious, of the form of the unconscious.
	* [[Speech in analysis]]

Saussure: in language, everything is based on relations, pure relational differentiality.
* Lacan: pure relational differentiality can only be based on a [[non-relation]], on *a different kind of difference.*
* The one (of the binary relation) has to be missing.

Signifiers are never pure signifiers, they are ridden from within with unexpected surpluses which ruin the logic of their pure differentiality.
* They are separated from the signified, no inherent connection leading from the signifier to its meaning. If this was all, the structure would be complete, without subject.
* Signifying chain constantly produces unexpected effects of meaning, surplus [[meaning]] that stains the signifiers from within.
    * This is the locus of the [[subject of the unconscious]]: Minus one/plus enjoyment is the structural topology where the subject of the unconscious dwells.
