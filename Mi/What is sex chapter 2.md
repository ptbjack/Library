**"THE INVISIBLE 'HANDJOB' OF THE MARKET"**

The non-relation is at work in all forms of social bond.

* In the field of love, the relation stops not being written from time to time.
* Social relations of power- domination, exploitation, discrimination- are forms of exploitation of the non-relation.

Abolishing the non-relation: emancipatory projects of 'new order', attempting to force the non-relation out of the social equation.

Vs.

Exploitation of the non-relation: 'narratives of the Relation', present a given form of social antagonism as the ultimate Relation, supposedly protecting us from the utter Chaos of the non-relation.

* Social injustice → higher Justice
* At the same time disavowing non-relation and appropriating it as the generic and productive point of social power.
* Actual, concrete exploitation is based on this appropriation of "privatization of the negative."
* E.g. capitalism:
    * Starts off with two revolutionary ideas: "the economic Relation does not exist" and "the non-relation could be very profitable".
    * The non-relation is profitable, it is the ultimate source of growth and profit.
    * Adam Smith:
        * Non-relation is a fundamental state
        * Individuals are driven by egotistic drives and the pursuit of self-interest, by ruthlessly pursuing one's own interest, one promotes the good of society as a whole much more efficiently that when one sets off to promote it directly.
            * What we find at the very core of the most selfish individual enjoyment is actually the Other.
        * Mistake: what we find at the core of this Other is a most "masturbatory self-enjoyment. Not only individuals never do what we think we are doing, the Other and its invisible hand also do not do only what they think they are doing.
            * The invisible hand of the market is always already the invisible handjob of the market, putting most of the wealth decidedly out of common reach.
    * Everybody is living better than two centuries ago, yet the price of this modern economic higher Relation is that the differences between the rich and poor are exponentially greater, fed by the non-relation in its "higher" form.
    * In order for the non-relation to be profitable, it has to be built into the very mode of production.
        * Marx: money → capital. What makes the products (labor power) also appears with them on the market as one of the products, objects for sale.
        * Capitalism exploits the point of negativity of the social order, capitalists are not "stealing" from the workers, they are employing them to make the negativity/entropy of the system work for them. They are making themselves enriched.
    * Labor power as commodity is the point that marks the constitutive negativity, gap, of this system: the point where one thing immediately falls into other (use value → source of value).
        * Labor power has no use value, it leaps over to the source of value.
        * "The Worker does not exist." What exists is the person whose work is sold and bought.
            * A Worker that existed would actually be a slave.
            * The proletariat is not simply one of the social classes, it names the point of the concrete constitutive negativity in capitalism.
                * Not the sum of all workers, the concept names the symptomatic point of this system, its disavowed and exploited negativity.
