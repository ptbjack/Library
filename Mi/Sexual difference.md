Original nonexistence of any germ of two sexes during preadolescence.[^1]
- Auto-erotic activity of the erotogenic zones is the same in both sexes.
* Libido is invariably of a masculine nature, whether it occurs in men or in women and irrespectively of whether its object is a man or a woman.
    * Masculinity and Femininity are just ideals that exist nowhere in reality.
    * If pure Masculinity and pure Femininity existed, their sexuality would be one and the same ("masculine")

Sexual difference does not arise from there being two sexes or two sexualities, but from the fact that there is no "second sex", and from an enigmatic indifference of the "sexual thing" (polymorphically perverse autoeroticism) that appears at the point of the "missing sex".[^1]
* What splits into two is the very nonexistence of the one (the one which would be the Other).
	* What splits in two is the very "one that lacks", the minus, the with-without.
* There is no subjectivity beyond (or simply outside) the sexual division.
    * Sexual difference is not a secondary distinction of subjectivity, or simply culturally constructed.
