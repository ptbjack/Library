[[Formulas of sexuation]]
S(Èº) : enjoyment appearing at the place of the gap of the non-emergence of one signifier is that of the unconscious, not as repressed, but as the very substance of the missing signifier which, as missing, gives its form to the unconscious.[^1]
- Limits of [[knowledge]]: one cannot know anything about the other's enjoyment, this enjoyment is not an object of knowledge because it is a place-holder for the knowledge which does not exist.
* This enjoyment appears because there is nothing to know there.
* _Woman's jouissance is the signifier of the lack of knowledge (in the Other); marks the point where the Other does not know._
* "Feminine jouissance" is not an obstacle to the sexual relation, but a symptom of its nonexistence.
	* [[Non-relation]]
