# The Translator's Task

Art presupposes man's corporal and spiritual essence but no work of art presupposes his attention.

Works of art (e.g. poetry) are not intended for the reader, which a bad translation is.
- **bad translation** is the inexact transmission of an inessential content.

**Translatability**; does a work of art allow itself to be translated?
- **relational concepts** not exclusively connected with human beings.
	- e.g. unforgettable life or moment even if all human beings had forgotten it.
	- reference to a thought in the mind of God.
- if translation is a **mode**, translatability must be essential to certain works.

Vital connection between the original and the translation:
- translation proceeds from the 'survival' (*Ãœberleben*) of the original.
- translation has no significance for the original; a specific significance inherent in the original texts expresses itself in their translatability.

**Life** as a concept comes to its own only when it is attributed to everything that has a history, and not to that which is only a stage setting for history.
- Philosopher's task: to understand all natural life on the basis of the more comprehensive life of history.

Translations owe their existence to the work's fame.

All purposeful phenomena of life are for the expression of life's essence, the representation of its significance.
- Translation can represent the most intimate relationships among languages by realizing it seminally or intensively
	- intensive; special mode of representation in linguistic life.
	- languages are a priori related to each other in what they want to say.

**Impossibility of a reflection theory**: there can be no objective knowledge or claim to such knowledge if it consists in reflections of the real.
- no translation would be possible if it were to strive for similarity to the original.
- the original is changed in **continuing life** (transformation and renewal of a living thing).
	- even the greatest translation is taken up into the growth of its language.

**Kinship of languages** does not necessarily involve similarity.
- suprahistorical kinship consists in the fact that a whole can only be attained by the totality of the languages' mutually complementary intentions.
	- **pure language**

intended object vs mode of intention:
- e.g. "Brot" and "pain"
	- intended object is the same
	- mode of intention is different
	- the relation between the mode of intention and the intended object is complemented in the two words.
	- **Pure language** only emerges when the intended object is encountered in relative independence, as in these two words.

Translation strives toward a decisive stage of all linguistic development.
- the original grows into a purer and higher linguistic sphere in translation.
- translation points to predetermined, inaccessible domain where languages are reconciled and fulfilled.
	- essential kernel, more than a message, that which is not retranslatable: the element toward which the genuine translator's efforts are directed remains out of reach.
- translation indicates higher language than its own and remains alien with respect to its content.
	- every translation represents translation into all other languages.

**Translator's task**: to find the intention toward the language into which the work is to be translated, on the basis of which an echo of the original can be awakened in it.
- Poetry's intention is never directed toward language as such in its totality.
	- the poet's intention is spontaneous, primary, concrete, whereas the translator's intention is derivative, final, ideal.
- agreement of languages and not individual propositions, poetic structures, and judgments.

- Fragments of a vessel: translation must fashion a counterpart to the original's mode of intention in its own language in order to make both of them recognizable as fragments of a greater language.
	- word-for-word translation may seem like ignoring the message, but it demonstrates that the word and not the sentence is the original element of translation.

**the kernel of pure language** (beyond the communicable) seeks to be represented and produced in the development of languages, it can either be symbolizing or symbolized.
- burdened with alien meaning in languages, only translation can unbind it from meaning and ***turn the symbolizing element into the symbolized itself***.

Freedom in translation it the freedom to contribute to the service of pure language.
- **Translator's task** is to set free in his own language the pure language spellbound in the foreign language.

Translation is like a tangent to a circle, touches the original only at the infinitely small point of meaning.
- In holy scripture, meaning is not mediating language and revelation. Such texts are unconditionally translatable, contain their virtual translation between the lines.
