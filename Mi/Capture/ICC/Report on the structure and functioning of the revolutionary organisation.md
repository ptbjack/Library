# Report on the structure and functioning of the revolutionary organisation

Constant characteristics of revolutionary organisations:
- existence of a programme valid for the whole organisation
	- expresses the historic future of the class by formulating goals and the way to attain them
	- gathers essential positions which the organisation must defend in the class
	- serves as a basis for joining the organisation
- unitary character; manifestation of unity is the centralization of its structure.

Circumstantial characteristics:
- greater/lesser scale
- the level at which its programmatic and organic unity is most directly manifested (national and international levels)

ICC's mode of organisation:
- organic and programmatic unity on an international scale
	- ICC emerged as an international organisation which subsequently gave rise to further territorial sections
- 'narrow' organisation, with strict criteria for joining

Centralism is the concretization of the organization's unitary character.
- the **whole** of the organisation takes precedence before the parts.
- the parts are delegated by the whole organisation.

International Congress is the highest moment in the unity of the organisation.
- the decisions of a Congress must serve as a constant point of reference for the whole life of the organisation.

The central organ is an instrument of the organisation, not the other way around.
- the organisation is not formed by a central organ plus militants, it is a unified network in which all parts overlap and work together.

Voting and elections are the best way of ensuring unity and widest participation of the whole organisation in its own life.

There is no **proportional representation** of minority positions within the central organ.
- Bourgeois organisation , the existence of divergences is based on defence of the interests of this or that sector, interests which have to be conciliated by 'fair' distribution of posts among their representatives.
- Communist organisation, divergences express a living and dynamic process of clarification of problems posed to the class.

**democratic centralism** must be rejected:
- marked by seal of Stalinism which used it to cover up liquidation of revolutionary life in the parties of the CI.
- [[Lenin]] himself wrongly asked for the banning of fractions
- hierarchical and 'military' character of the organisation should be rejected.

**organic** ([[Bordigo]]) must be rejected:
- Bordigism used the fact that a majority doesn't guarantee a correct position to ban votes and elections
- leaders arise 'by themselves' through organic process: means giving the 'center' the job of deciding everything, leading this 'center' to align itself behind the positions of a **historic leader** who has divine infallibility.

Voting and elections are the best way of guaranteeing the maximum unity and life in the organisation.

Organisation of revolutionaries cannot be monolithic.
- Marxism is not a dogma, it is the theoretical instrument of a class which, with a view towards its historic future, advances gradually towards a self-awareness.

Rules for discussion in which divergences strengthen the organisation, importantly the rejection of secret and bilateral correspondence.
- debates which concern the whole proletariat should be expressed publicly, supervised by the central organs responsible for publications: rejection of the publication of texts on the 'private' initiative of a number of members.

Difference between a **tendency** and a **fraction**:
- Tendency develops on points determining the orientation and intervention of the organization, it is not constituted straight away around points of theoretical analyses.
- A fraction is formed around programmatic differences and tends to take on an organized form with its own organs of propaganda.

The influence of elements from the student milieu after 1968 allowed the reappearance of **individualism**:
- There is no direct relationship between the militants and the class.
- Militants have no particular 'salvation' to gain in front of the class or history.
- The organisation is not the product of the needs of the militant.
- Both theoretical elaboration and realization of practical tasks are equally important, there is no hierarchy.
- Spirit of careerism must be banished from the organisation as being opposed to **disinterested dedication**.
- any practice of 'recuperating' material or funds from the organization is alien to the proletariat.
