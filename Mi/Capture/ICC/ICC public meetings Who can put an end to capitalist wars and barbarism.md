# ICC public meetings: Who can put an end to capitalist wars and barbarism?

Affirmation of the international class struggle as the only force that can really oppose war.
- Internationalists are swimming against the current, as they were in 1914.

**Capitalism in decay**:
- the current war, following the COVID pandemic, intensification of military barbarism
- **decomposition**

Working class:
- took a hit in Ukraine, working class was drowned by the mobilization for the "defence of the nation"
- in Russia, rebellion and opposition to war.
- The ruling class is no longer able to use working class as military force, more and more they turn to professional armies.

[[Lenin]]: the chain of world capitalism will break in its "weakest link", in less developed countries, on the model of Russia in 1917.
- [[Capture/ICC/ICC]]: the more politically developed working class of Western Europe will be key to the generalization of the class struggle.

Primacy of establishing and developing international contacts and activities, integrating local and national specificities into a more global framework of analysis.

The working class doesn't give rise to revolutionary militants but to revolutionary organizations: there is no direct relationship between the militants and the class.
