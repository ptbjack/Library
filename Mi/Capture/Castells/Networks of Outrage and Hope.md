# Opening: Networking Minds, Creating Meaning, Contesting Power

2008, trust vanished, social contract dissolved.
- People disappear, transform into defensive individuals.

Internet social networks are spaces of autonomy.
- They are beyond the control of governments and corporations that had monopolized the channels of communication as the foundation of their power.

Movements in late 2000s, people left the safety of cyberspace to occupy urban spaces.

Humiliation provoked by the cynicism and arrogance of those in power turned fear into outrage, and outrage into hope for a better humanity.
* search for dignity

Movements ==ignored political parties, did not recognize any leadership and rejected all formal organization.== They relied on the Internet and local assemblies for collective decision-making.

[[Communication Power]] (2009):
- Power relationships are constitutive of society.
	- Those with power construct the institutions of society according to their values and interests.
	- Power is exercised by coercion (monopoly of violence) and by **the construction of meaning in people's minds through symbolic manipulation.**
- **Counterpower**: capacity of social actors to challenge the power embedded in institution of society for the purpose of claiming representation for their own values and interests.
	- constant interaction between power and counterpower configures the state and other institutions.
- ==The fundamental power struggle is the battle for the construction of meaning in the minds of the people==.
	- If a majority think contrary to the values and norms institutionalized in laws and regulations, the system will change.
- **Communication** is the process of sharing meaning through the exchange of information.
	- Act of communication operates networking neural networks with those of nature and social networks.
	- the key source of social production of meaning is the process of **socialized communication**.
- **Mass self-communication** is the use of the Internet as a platform of digital communication.
	- Mass because it processes messages from many to many.
	- Self-communication because the sender autonomously decides the production of the message, the designation of the receiver is self-directed and the retrieval of messages is self-selected.
	- Based on horizontal networks of interactive communication which are difficult to control by governments or corporations.
	- Provides the technological platform for the construction of the autonomy of the social actor vis-a-vis the institutions of society.
- Networks of power engage in strategies of partnership by forming ad hoc networks around specific projects.
	- All networks of power are interested in controlling the capacity of defining the rules of society through a political system.
	- The stable operation of the system and the reproduction of power relationships in every network depend on the coordinating and regulatory functions of the state.
		- e.g. 2008 financial markets collapsed and governments were called to the rescue.
	- ==The state constitutes the default network for the proper functioning of all other power networks==.
- Who holds power in the network society?
	- ***Programmers*** who program each of the main networks on which people's lives depend(government, military, finance institutions etc.),
	- ***Switchers*** who operate the connections between different networks (media moguls, financial elites bankrolling political elites and vice versa, academic institutions financed by big business, etc.),
		- **Switching power**: capacity to connect networks in the process of making power for each in their respective fields.
- Counterpower is enacted by programming networks around alternative interests and/or disrupting the dominant switches while switching networks of resistance and social change.
- Social movements also need to build public space by creating free communities in the urban space, carving out a new public space that is not limited to the Internet and makes itself visible in the places of social life.
	- Occupying urban space and symbolic buildings creates ==community based on togetherness to overcome fear==.
	- Occupied spaces are charged with symbolic power of invading sites of state power. Citizens reclaim the city from which they were evicted by real estate speculation and municipal bureaucracy.
		- e.g. 1871 Paris Commune, 1915 Glasgow strikes.
	- Hybrid space between the Internet social networks and the occupied urban space.
		- ==Public space of autonomous communication==.
- Social movements are made of individuals: the actual practices are enacted by persons in their flesh and minds.

At the individual level, social movements are emotional movements (insurgency doesn't start with a program or political strategy).
- emotion --> action
- ***theory of affective intelligence***: fear and enthusiasm are most relevant to social mobilization and political behavior.
	- Approach system: goal-seeking behavior, rewarding experiences.
		- Hope projects behavior into the future.
	- For enthusiasm to emerge, individuals have to overcome the negative emotion resulting from the avoidance system.
		- Anxiety is a response to an external threat over which the threatened person has no control.
		- Overcoming anxiety leads to anger.

The more interactive and self-configurable communication is, the less hierarchical is the organization and the more participatory is the movement. Networked social movement of the digital age represent a new species of social movement.

Movements become raw materials for ideological experimentation or political instrumentation.
- e.g. the Commune of Paris became a proto-proletarian revolution in Marx's correspondence with Elizabeth Dmitrieva.

# Prelude to Revolution: Where It All Started

Movements in the 21st century all have in common the feeling of empowerment, prompted by outrage towards the perceived complicity between the financial and political elites.

## Tunisia: "The Revolution of Liberty and Dignity"

2010, December 17: Mohammed Bouazizi self-immolation.
2011, January 14: Army refused to open fire on protesters.

Free communication on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and the occupation of urban space created ==hybrid public space of freedom.==

2011, January 22: Convoy of freedom, occupied governmental palace.
- Filmed debates and posted on Internet.
- Informal organization, democracy and freedom of speech (everybody entitled to express opinion)
- Soft surveillance network by protesters.

National movement, using the national flag and anthems, anti-colonial.
- Not Islamic movement, but strong Islamist current among protesters.

Opposing political parties were ignored by activists. Protesters generated ==ad hoc leadership== in specific times and places.

Feelings of humiliation emerged out of objective conditions of poverty etc. 
- [[Rabble]]
- Protests initiated individually in the connection between social networks on the Internet and those offline.
	- ==Existence of an Internet culture was the precondition for the revolts.==

Symbiotic relationship between citizen journalists uploading images and information and Al Jazeera broadcasting feeds to the population at large.
- Al Jazeera developed communication program to allow mobile phones to connect directly to its satellite.

Unemployed college graduates (young age, high education and use of Internet) were key actors in the revolution who utilized communicative potential of Internet to build and expand the movement.

2011, October 23: open elections, moderate Islamist coalition comes to power.
- ==Not return to tradition, self-determined modernity.==
- Similar to AKP.

## Iceland's Kitchenware Revolution: From Financial Collapse to Crowdsourcing a New Constitution

Economic crisis:
- Speculative creation of wealth by big banks.
- 2006, February: Fitch rating down, Central Bank borrows to increase foreign exchange reserves.
- Love letters; banks swap debt securities to use each other's debt as collateral to borrow more money from the Central Bank.

2008, October 11: Singer Hordur Torfason sings in front of parliament
2009, January 28: Thousands gather in front of Parliament, beating on pots and pans ("kitchen revolution")
2009, February 1: coalition of social democrats and "red-greens", openly gay prime minister.

Banks nationalized, referandum refuses to pay debts of banks.
- New prime minister: "The quality of life Icelanders have in the future will be built on equality."

How did they rescue the new democratic government from a major economic disaster?
- Did not promote austerity measures, "social stability pact".
- Devaluation of currency had positive impact on exports and tourism
- Government established control of capital flows, preventing flight of capital from the country.

New constitution:
- Parliament appointed 1000 randomly selected citizens to constitutional committee.
- ==Wiki-constitution==: online suggestions, widespread deliberation of 15 different versions of the text.
* "one person, one vote", freedom of information, respect of nature.
	* Principles that are revolutionary in the context of global capitalism are reflected: Direct link between process of popular crowdsourcing and the content resulting from the participatory process.
* Scalable model of political participation and crowdsourcing.

[[Corsican Constitution of 1755]], Rousseau: "power derived from population more real than finance... a state rich in money is always weak, and a state rich in men is always strong."
## Southern Wind, Northern Wind: Cross-Cultural Levers of Social Change

In both countries, democratic deficit was a major source of discontent at the root of the protests.
Both countries are highly homogeneous in ethnicity and in religion.
In both cases, the movement went from cyberspace to urban space.
- ==Occupation of symbolic public square as material support for protests.==
