# 2 Strangers on a Train

"I never do anything important." Bruno's impotence, probably sexual, he is prying into Guy's love life.

Bruno is embodiment of Guy's desire.

* Associated with darkness throughout the film, he is trying to force himself into the light as the film develops.


Miriam works in a record shop--- revolving objects (hint to merry-go-round)

* Vicious circle of life from which Guy is trying to break free
* Fairground is symbolic representation of Miriam's world of disorder, of the pursuit of fun and cheap glamor.

The murder in the fairground, sexual.

* Bruno's shadow overtakes Miriam's in the tunnel of love.
* Sexual perversion associated with sense of damnation (Bruno is forerunner of Norman Bates).

Bruno helps blind man across the street --- unconscious act of atonement.

Light and darkness when Bruno calls from the shadows.

Bruno's gradual emergence from darkness is the emergence of the spectator's desires.

* The spectator is drawn into the film by the use of subjective shots and the undermining of order.
    * E.g. Mrs Cunningham scene, we are almost implicated in another murder.

Hitchcock's essence: ordered life depends on the unnatural suppression of a seductive underworld of desire.

The scene where Guy goes to commit Bruno's murder:

* Suspense external, cheap tricks?

* Was he intending from the beginning not to kill the father?
    * The spectator's uncertainty is that of the character, he doesn't know what to do
    * But the uncertainty of the character isn't realized well
* Turning point of the film, now Bruno is against Guy, not with him.

Cross-cutting between the tennis match and Bruno's journey with the lighter:

* Simpler suspense, the good and the evil are separated.
* Tennis in daylight vs dark sewers; the fight for dominance of superego and id.
* The lighter is Guy's concrete link with the ordered world, and he must risk everything, change his personality (changes tennis style) and risk losing everything to retrieve it.

# 4 Vertigo

Prologue and three movements

Opening credits--- blank mask, impossibility of knowing what goes on behind it.

Scott suspended over an abyss through the film.

Midge, rational, modern woman. Her sexuality is devoid of mystery or reserve

Madelaine is associated with death and the past

First half of the film uses audience's escapist expectations; they want to see a 'hero' with whom they can identify, involved in romantic wish fulfillments.

Midge tries to alienate Scott from his fantasy, but ends up alienating him from her. She cannot satirize the fantasy, make him see Midge in that slot which is already filled?

Dream sequence at the end of first half: 

* Carlotta possesses Madeleine in death.
* Madeleine identification with the portrait complete
    * Identification of dream and reality, life and death
* Scott achieves identification with Madeleine in his dream by falling into her grave and then falling onto the roof.
    * Desire for annihilation

At the mental institution--- Scottie in melancholia, the music has artificiality.

* Midge accepts impotence and disappears into the darkness
    * Similar to Scottie disappearing into the stairs after Madeleine dies: both made aware of the ultimate impossibility of getting through to another person in the deepest essentials.

Hitchcock giving away the surprise when Scott sees Judy:

* Audience is disappointed because our discontent with reality has been penetrated, we are caught off guard.


The illusion is not just an illusion: Judy became Madeleine up to a point.

* The first two thirds of the film; what Judy says is ambiguous as to what they are addressing
    * E.g. 'sitting in a room alone' could be McKittrick but also Judy's room.
* Judy's fears released through being Madeleine: Madeleine is Judy's self-expression??

Identity unstable: Scottie has different names with different people: identity created by the relationship.

Why did Hitchcock give away the explanation of Judy early?

* If he had not, our identification with Scott would have gone through to the end, only at the end would be have been left stranded with 'reality'.
    * Suspense would have gone on until the end; surrender to the re-created dream and suspicion of the possibility of fraud.
* Effect of revelation is to detach us from Scottie's consciousness
    * Allows us to study how Scottie can achieve health only by following through to the end an obsession that has its source in a spiritual sickness.
        * *DEATH DRIVE/ TRAVERSAL OF FANTASY?
* We are made aware of Judy's feeling as well as of Scottie's.

Tension in relationship: Scottie cannot see Judy, only the ghost of Madeleine.

* Judy has taken over from Midge--- she is unsuccessfully trying to keep him in the "real" world.
* Tendency in relationships to form an idealized image of the other person and substitute it for the reality.

End of the film: Scottie can look down from the tower, he is cured but he also destroyed the reality and illusion of Judy/Madelaine

# 5 North by Northwest

Triviality of Bond films vs the integrity of North by Northwest.

Work of art must be thematically organic.

Art taking itself seriously

The plot of Northwest -how not serious it is- functions to direct attention to other levels.

Mistake in Saboteur and 39 Steps: having the villain and not the hero dangle from the top of the Statue of Liberty.

Also different: the characters in Northwest have different relationship to the action.

Thornhill easy to identify with, modern shallow man. First movement of the film strips protective armor away.

The spies are projection of the chaos underlying modern order as the agents whereby that order is destroyed.

Large shot outside UN after real Townsend is killed: The self-confident advertising man is reduced to a speck, isolated.

Eve Kendall: perfect counterpart to uninvolved Thornhill, but soon is concerned about him etc. Vulnerable.

* Wicked woman drawn into true love against her will.


Crop duster scene is midpoint of film?

* Thornhill was INSIDE before this scene, now he is OUTSIDE, 'modern man deprived of all his amenities and artificial resources'.


Final movement: Thornhill accepts being Kaplan for Eve's sake but first he must go to Mount Rushmore and take on the responsibility.

# 6 Psycho

Normal → abnormal

* The hold of past on the present gets tighter and tighter but was present in the beginning of the film also (Sam's father's debt).


Exposition outside → inside; sense that this could be us.

Identification with Marion:

* She forfeits her powers of conscious will --- there is no moment of decision in stealing the 40,000$.
* Loss of rational control, how easily a "normal" person can lapse into neurosis.

Marion and Norman--- continuity between the normal and the abnormal.

Shower scene:

* Marion ritualistic, having decided to give back the money, she is washing away her guilt.
* Meaninglessness which undermines restored sense of security.
* Brutal breaking off of identification.

Shift of center to Norman, who is identifiable, helpless.

* Identification--- subjective camera when he cleans up Marion's remains
* Marion's reminder is a bundle of paper (money).

Shower drain → Marion's eye: we have emerged from the depths behind the eye.

Cellar, sex symbol:

* Mocking "eyes" of the living dead, true eyes of Norman.


Psychiatrist's explanation: tendency to evade the implications of the film.

# 7 The Birds

Two red herrings:

* Possessive mother
* Identification with Melanie

Thematic and technique extension from film to film in Hitchcock is not likely.

* *The Birds *is not continuation of the same themes as *Psycho*


Attic scene similar to the shower murder in *Psycho*, Norman Bates becomes a bid of prey when carrying out his murders.

* Also, feeling the unreasonableness of life in both scenes.


Why do the birds attack? No explanation, all signification fails.

* Birds are a concrete embodiment of the arbitrary and unpredictable, of whatever makes human life and human relationships precarious, of the possibility that life is meaningless and absurd.


Opening scene:

* Outside, reality with its constant menace of instability (ominous birds)
    * Inside, safe and artificial world that sophisticated human beings fabricate and call reality.
* Melanie is imprisoned in a gilded cage of sophisticated triviality, an inability to be sincere which is an inability to live.

Drive to Bodega Bay, similar to Marion's drive in Psycho, but here we are at liberty to respond in different ways, we are not confined to Melanie's view.

Identification with Melanie is blocked,

* We are looking at Melanie, not with her
* Use of back-projection is only when we are looking at her.

First attack on Melanie: involvement (identification) and judgement simultaneously at work.

Annie, Lydia, Melanie: contrasting personalities but are connected in the way they look, the way they speak (intonations, "I see"), connection of the human condition itself.

Melanie's complacency and triviality are tied as neurotic symptoms over which she has little command.

That children are the victims of bird attacks: meaninglessness and unpredictability of the attacks. To demand consistency and any form of divine or poetic justice from the attacks is to miss the point.

Chimney attack; Lydia's neat masculine house is disrupted.

Mitch us supposed to be the hero but the birds make the concept untenable.

Why does Melanie go upstairs alone?

* She thinks that nothing will happen to her, residuum of complacency.
* Desire for annihilation?

# 12 Symmetry, Closure, Disruption: The Ambiguity of Blackmail

Classical realist narrative has two functions: to reinforce the patriarchal order, and having symmetry (the end and the beginning) and closure (of moral and narrative threads).

* Symmetry and closure can possibly work towards not affirming patriarchy.

* Symmetry marks difference.


Blackmail's privileged status as the first of Hitchcock's guilty woman films.

Symmetry within shot: the undressing scene in the artist's studio, triangle of Alice, Frank, and the blackmailer in the back room of the store.

Symmetry between the end and beginning of the movie; arrest of male criminal, scene at police station with Alice arriving, the three-way conversation between Alice, Frank and the constable.

Undermining of power; dehumanization and villianization of the police intruding into the private space in the beginning, the dehumanized faces in the mirror.

* Opening establishes the police as the representatives of a repressive male bourgeois order.


Head of Egyptian god vs the jester: first is the symbol of heartless authority, second is figure that ridicules all authority.

Woman trapped in the impossible situations the patriarchal system creates.

Pairs:

* Policeman/Jester: policeman walking under window first reassures, then is outside POV of Alice. The jester's object of laugher is nonspecific, at the end it is laughing at the audience.
* The two pictures
* The dresses

# 13 Norms and Variations: The 39 Steps and Young and Innocent

The 39 Steps established the "double chase" theme.

* Genre: 'picaresque' inconsequential assemblage of scenes whose common link is that each is a further adventure for the protagonist.
* The espionage plot as a cover for concerns with gender relations and sexuality.

Finger with its missing top joint --- sign of castration.

* Central, close up


Symmetry, formal scheme:

* The end answers the beginning --- Mr memory performance with gunshot
* Second scene, negotiation between Hannay and Annabella vs at the inn, Pamela and Hannay

British music hall:

* In the beginning, for urban proletariat → Palladium at the end, middle class

* Spontaneous disruption in the music hall, vs shooting in Palladium
* Hannay alien in music hall

Annabella is a kind of prostitute; she is a spy for 'any country that pays me'.

* Her death displaces the sexual transgression to espionage


Father figures in Hitchcock:

* Ineffectual, symbolically castrated, predominantly comic (e.g. Blackmail, Young and Innocent)
* Oppressive, sinister, dominating--- either 'good law' or 'bad law' (e.g. The 39 Steps, Saboteur, Jamaica Inn)
* Dichotomy parallel with Hitchcock's presentation of the police.

The Professor: bourgeois ideal, upper-class respectability.

* Ideal social arrangement, has to pay the price of symbolic castration to become "the Father".


Hannay is blank character: Canadian is negatively identified (not British, not American).

* Relationship with Pamela is negatively defined also: neither a one-night stand nor a brutal domination nor a traditional marriage/family.


Hannay's masculinity;

* Avoids threat of castration (professor's bullet doesn't go through)


Young and Innocent:

* The couple's narrative is more equal
* The birthday scene shows the bourgeois social norms, 'normality'.
    * Monstrous matriarch mother and ineffective father.
    * In between two visits to working-class environments.
* Police chief and murderer opposite, complementary poles of patriarchal domination
    * Chief is in control, murderer not
    * Both apply same moral law of punishment for deviancy.

# 14 Ideology, Genre, Auteur

Each theory of film insists on its own particular polarization:

* Montage theory --- editing is enthroned as the essential creative act

* Realist theory--- downgrades montage and artifice
* Semiotic theory--- rejects realist theory in favor of the 'open text'
* Auteur theory--- concentrates on the fingerprints of the individual artist.
* "Filmic text"--- throws out ideas of personal authorship.

Complex interaction of ideology, genre, and personal authorship that determines the richness of meaning of the great Hollywood masterpieces.

American capitalist ideology:

* Honest toil is in itself and for itself morally admirable
    * Moral excellence of work is bound up with the necessary subjugation or sublimation of the libido.
* Heterosexual monogamy; homestead is built for the Woman, whose function is to embody civilized values and guarantee their continuance through her children.
* Nature as agrarianism; the virgin land as Garden of Eden
* Nature as the wilderness, the Indians, on whose subjugation civilization is built.
* Progress, technology, the city.
* Success/wealth
* The Rosebud syndrome: the more oppressed you are, the happier you are; the poor are happier.
* America as the land where everyone actually is/can be happy.
    * Happy ending of film "emergency exit" for the spectator
    * Subversive systems are assimilated to serve the dominant ideology.
* Ideal Male: virile adventurer, potent man of action
* Ideal Female: wife and mother, perfect companion, dependable, mainstay of hearth and home.

The development of genres is rooted in the ideological contradictions in the list.

Treating genres as discrete is an obstacle.

Works are of interest when the defined particularities of an auteur (individual) interact with specific ideological tensions and the film is fed from more than one generic source.

Ideological tensions:* Shadow of a Doubt* and *Its A Wonderful Life*

* Influx of film noir into the world of small-town domestic comedy.
* Intervention of a clearly defined artistic personality in an ideological generic structure.

*Shadow of a Doubt*:

* Consistent Catholic interpretation of Hitchcock: original sin, loss of innocence, exchange of guilt vs.
    * Dependent on the abstracting of elements from the whole.
* Ideological project: preserving the small town while acknowledging the existence of sickness and evil.
* Bar scene: revelation of the fallen-World/capitalist-corruption-and-deprivation at the heart of the American small town.
* Uncle Charlie: ambiguously devil and lost soul.
* Hitchcock's identification with Uncle Charlie: the hand of spades, sign of death
* Small town façade.
* Sexuality through the cracks of the family: Uncle/niece, brother/sister
* Charlie's sickness product of capitalist ideology

# 15 Star and Auteur: Hitchcock's Films with Bergman

Psychoanalytic approach to films has comprehensive and definitive, exclusive claim. It is reductive.

Laura Mulvey: male spectator. Woman is looked at.

* Notorious: male gaze identification → ideology on woman
    * Split identification between Alex and Cary Grant: Alex is Bad Law, but also a victim of his mother.
    * Woman as good wife and deceiver, betrayer.
* This reading reduces complexities to significations.

Identification is not just the look (gaze), six points:

* Male gaze: 
    * this perspective overly generalized to film practice as a whole.
* The victim:
    * Natural tendency to identify with the threatened. First scene, Alicia threatened by male gaze reporters.
* Sympathy, empathy:
    * Alicia and Sebastian, first is stronger, second is only compassion.
* Sharing of a consciousness:
    * Intellectual identification
    * Questioning emotional identification, being intimate with neurotic evil characters.
* The use of cinematic devices:
    * More POV shots from Alicia's POV.
    * Alicia coming to understand that she is being poisoned:
        * Objective → POV → subjective POV → expressionist camera
* Identification with the star:
    * Bergman always privileged.

Only the first point privileges males.

**Bergman as star:**

* How can a female star dominate the films in which she appears fail to become threatening within the structures of patriarchal culture?
* Bergman as anti-Garbo and new Garbo
* Garbo and Dietrich, woman as inaccessible and mysterious.
* Natural and healthy woman, construction but she is accessible, outside the "feminine mystique".
    * Natural and normal don't go together: untrammeled female sexuality upon which the subjugation and regulation of patriarchy is built.
    * Bergman is masculine, assertive with her natural smile.
    * The sexual is more threatening than the "sexy".
* Dealing with this natural sexuality, Casablanca etc. Contains it in the promise of bourgeois marriage or renunciation.
* Actor vs. star
    * The great role
    * Versatility
    * Emotional authenticity
* Illness to deal with natural sexuality: (1940s)
    * She is poisoned in Notorious and insane in Under Capricorn.
    * Theme: men attempt to destroy Bergman's smile and its triumphantly restored
* Under Capricorn:
    * Confession scene
        * acting
        * The Lady Henrietta: naturalness
* Spellbound:
    * Masculinity lost, nature gained, femininity when masculine psychologist falls in love.
    * Active female sexuality

**From identification to the exposure of ideology: the female system of *Notorious*:**

* Restoration of Bergman's naturalness, coincides with release of sexuality.
* Devlin's love is of possession and control, Sebastian tries to murder her.
    * Devlin's scarf.
* Devlin rescues the girl in patriotic guise, but goes against patriarchal authority.
* Female system that turns the male system on its head and subjects it to criticism.

***Under Capricorn*: Bergman, Gender, and Class:**

* Intertextuality, similar to the Manxman, Rebecca
* Punishment for transgression, masculinity appropriation: she is the one who shoots her brother.
* Woman-centered melodrama; from woman's pov.
* Identification:
    * First, Charles:
        * He is outside all the classes in Australia
        * POV shots
    * Split between him and Henrietta
    * Complicated by the crane movements that disclose events and info outside the consciousness of either men.
* Henrietta: Charles treats her as only "lady", Sam celebrates all the masculinity.
* Class:
    * Similar to Manxman, woman loves lower class but is loved by rich man.
    * If Henrietta and Sam must end up together it is because their love for each other transgresses society's artificial boundaries of gender and class.
    * Both Charles and Milly act to pull apart the couple by playing upon their class prejudices.

# 16 The Murderous Gays: Hitchcock's Homophobia

Constitutional bisexuality:

* Freud: child is polymorphously perverse
* innate bisexuality
* adults are the real perverts

Masculinity/Femininity:

* Children are both masculine and feminine, these opposed characteristics are not tied to anatomical difference.


Repression:

* Patriarchy cannot endure ambiguity, it requires "real men" and "real women" for the maintenance of its power and the family.
* If successful, the Oedipal trajectory ends in the repression of "femininity" for men.

Homophobia:

* What is repressed can potentially resurface.
* Every expression of homophobia is revealing.

Men's hatred of women:

* What is repressed must be disowned, violence


**The dark side of gender construction**

Hitchcock's films: sense of precariousness and unpredictability, that something terrible may erupt at any moment within the most seemingly moment and secure environment.

* Paranoid mentality
    * Male paranoia is double bind: repression of homosexuality AND femininity, violence against other men AND women.

Hitchcock was at ease with homosexuals

* Subjectivity transcended gender
* But, tension between identification and distance, ambivalence

During his films with Ivor Novello, Hitchcock put on weight and got married.

* Defense against the feelings aroused by Novello?


Practical jokes:

* Kaufmann: triad of violence, masculinity.


Hitchcock's films, gay and attractive villains threaten to "take over" the films as the center of sympathy.

* Partial identification figures who must be repudiated
* If not explicitly gay, they are fascist or psychopathological.

**Who killed David Kentley?**

*Rope*, reinforcing  harmful myths of homosexuality (association with neurosis and fascism).

André Bazin: the long shot is the most democratic, without the manipulations of the montage, the viewer is free to choose what they will focus on.

* In *Rope*, Hitchcock exerts total control over the gaze and emotional response of the viewer.


Are the two gays lovers?

* The film cannot answer this question
* One bedroom or two bedrooms?

1948, homosexuality was the love whose name could not be spoken because to speak it would be to acknowledge its existence.

Brandon's vulnerability: arrogant assumption of control undermined by the impossibility of maintaining it, stutter.

As Brandon and Philip cannot love each other, they must be ashamed of sexual activities they have performed together and hate each other for it, they commit a sexual act that society condones to the extent that it can be represented on the cinema screen: murder of David Kentley.

**Metteurs-en-scene**

Brandon is a typical figure of identification as he exemplifies the desire-for-power/fear-of-impotence syndrome that characterizes male Hitchcock identification figures, heroes and villains.

* Brandon: the particular form through which is drive to dominate expresses itself is mise-en-scene. 


Party guests are both actors to be manipulated and the audience Brandon desired.

_Acknowledgment entails exposure:_ audience can only acknowledge the art by becoming aware of the things of which they are supposed to remain unconscious, the extent to which they have been manipulated, whether by montage or by *Rope*'s continuous reframings.

Brandon's being gay is no impediment to Hitchcock's identification with him.

* Neurosis: instinctual rebellion against the sexual and genderic regulation of culture.


Transference of identification: Rupert usurps the role of metteur-en-scene.

**17 The Men Who Knew Too Much (And the Women Who Knew Much Better)**

The first is minor comedy, the 1956 version is not subversive--- does not allow for radical critique of patriarchal structures.

Contrast between the first and last shot of the family (being separated by the child vs united by the child).

**Hitchcock and Politics**

* 1956 version--- international assassination political statement is suppressed.

* Masculinist politics, women are exploited or used as pawns.

* *Notorious*--- the hero redeems himself when he rejects masculinist politics in favor of identifying with a woman and rescuing her from victimization.

* Political level of films represent a logical extension of obsessive sexual concerns into the structures of power politics.
* Screams in Man 2 are protests of women against masculinist politics.

**Hitchcock and Mothers**

* Hitchcock is concerned with the dark side of motherhood
* Bad mothers only in American films
* Jo is the only good mother
    * Her name is masculine, she is active, dynamic etc.
    * She is a good mother because she is not just a mother; if she is the exception to the rule, she is also its proof.

**Identification and Gender**

Problems with Bellour's argument that Hitchcock offers only male spectator identification and subordination of female desire to male desire:

* Existence of innate bisexuality--- transsexual identification
* How a star functions in films, tension between technically constructed identification and emotional identification
    * *Vertigo*: emotional identification with Judy but the film is shot from POV of Scott.
    * Notorious: identification with "female system" turns the male system on its head.
        * Male anxiety, culture's investment in masculinity
        * Fusion of fascination and disturbance, male enacts revenge on woman for arousing fears about masculinity.
    * Man 2: equal status of identification, primary identification with the woman, doubling the woman, identification with the female position exposes the domination drive's mechanisms.

**Genre**

1956 version is complicated, action is intruded by the domestic melodrama.

* Disturbance about gender roles and social positions: oppression of women within the family, marriage vs. Career, motherhood.


**Stars**

James Stewart: masculine power/impotence syndrome.

* Standing over women, dominating and helpless, out of control.
* Cary Grant doesn't try to dominate women.

**The Two Versions**

Structure realized differently in two versions.

* Stability of sexual ideology
    * Hegemony of family and dominance by males strong in 1934
* Switzerland/Marrakesh
    * No alienness in Swiss, but full alien in Morocco
    * Muslim woman and her veil--- possession by husband and Jo liberates herself at the end of film.
* Stability of marriage: Jo could not have flirted with Louis Bernard, marriage solid in 1934 version so wife can play.
* Betty → Hank: woman is compensated for her loss of career with a son, phallus.
* It is Jo who has the right instincts and perceptions.
* Rational man vs intuitive woman: rationality limited, understands very little.
