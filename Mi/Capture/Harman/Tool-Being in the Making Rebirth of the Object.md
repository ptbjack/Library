Philosophy starts with uncertainty and not with certainty.
- NOT with Descartes' res cogitans (but more with his doubt?)
- Modern philosophy acts like geometry, proving disproving until irrefutable knowledge.
- Philosophy - *love* of wisdom, not S2 Knowledge
- [[Whitehead]]: philosophies are not refuted, they are abandoned (no longer seen coherent or adequate)
	- Parmenides was not adequate, "being is and non-being is not"

Realism: there is a reality outside of any relation.
- True realist talks about object-object relations.
	- Human-object relation is another object-object relation.
- Translation goes on in any relation, all objects are limited to their respective phenomenal worlds.
	- e.g. fire burning cotton, they don't interact with all of each other's properties.

[[Heidegger]]: we take things for granted, our consciousness is actually minimal.
- You notice things when they break, not when things are going well. 
- Tool analysis is about the Thing itself.
- Heidegger should be referred to as the philosopher of objects that break, objects that are not smooth-functioning equipment but are independent.

Meaning of Being: being is that which is not immediately present for us.
- Withdrawal: nothing becomes fully present to anyone.
	- Scientific conception of an object is never going to be complete, it is going to be more and more complete but not fully.
	- Absolute knowledge is impossible.
	- [[Aristotle]]: you cannot define a substance, you describe it with universals (red, hard etc.).

Two kinds of knowledge: what its made of (undermining) and what it does (overmining)
- Knowledge does not exhaust our cognition of an object.
	- Something unknowable remains, we can only hint at it.
	- Art: *Guernica* 

Getting at a thing indirectly: aesthetics (artist calls attention to the third object).
- Indirect forms of discourse, philosophy is not knowledge.
	- Philosophy is opposed to literalism.
- Metaphor 
	- Pseudodionysius: description of the holy trinity, a light with three sources, merging into one light.
	- Metaphor isn't reversible (the subject cannot switch)
		- metaphor cannot be too close or too far to being convincing (?) (pen is a pencil is not aesthetically pleasing mostly)
	- Non-literal connection.

Third object is neither positive or negative ([[Kant]] - transcendental object is an empty form (x));
- [[Popper]]'s theory of falsification-- science as moving away from a current theory.
	- [[Darwin]] - moving away, evolution is shocking because humans are not the end-goal.

Without a human beholder, an artwork isn't an artwork.
- [[Gaze]]

[[Meillassoux]] : mathematical equations have truth about an object.
- object is not just the equation, it is also matter.
- [[Harman]] : we don't need matter

[[Badiou]] : mathematics is ontology.
- His complicated concepts
