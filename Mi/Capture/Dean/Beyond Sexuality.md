# 6 - Lacan Meets Queer Theory

Lacan speaks of homosexuality in* Encore*, as far as love is concerned, gender is irrelevant. Desire is determined by* ***objet petit a** which is independent of gender. So, Lacan frees desire from normative heterosexuality- from the assumption that all desire is effectively heterosexual by virtue of its flowing between masculine and feminine subject-positions.

Freud: the sexual instinct is the first instance independent of its object; nor is its origin likely to be due to its object's attractions.

Dean argues that radical Freudian tradition discredits the notion that homosexual desire expresses "a feminine soul trapped in a masculine body" and vice versa. Also discredits the idea that psychoanalysis is a modern technology designed to regulate and normalize sexuality.

## Nature/ Nurture - Neither

Freud's American translation and perception attempts to institutionalize psychoanalysis and cure the unconscious out of existence. They disregard Freud's conclusion that "all human beings are capable of making homosexual object-choice and have in fact made one in their unconscious." Keeping the emphasis on the unconscious, Lacan's critique of American ego psychology is appropriable for queer theory's critique of institutionalized homophobia.

Freud: universalizing conception of homosexuality instead of minoritizing conception. However, Freud's universalizing conception as a notion of object-choice trapped within the terms of gender since the possibility of describing object-choice as homosexual/heterosexual takes for granted that the object chosen is gendered.
* Lacan's concept of object *a* leaves gender behind.


European understanding of sexual difference vs North American understanding of gender.
* Usually, nature vs nurture.
* The force of gender lies in how it denaturalizes sexual difference.

Sexuality usually involves identity as well as desire: the issue of one's sexuality refers to one's own gender identity, one's masculinity and femininity.
* Psychoanalysis enables us to think sexuality (desire) apart from ego (identity).
* Not nature nor nurture: sexuality involves the unconscious (as an index of how both biology and culture fail to determine subjectivity and sexual desire). Lacan offers alternative to essentialist and social constructionist poles of the debate.
    * Essentialist: genetics, biological cause of homosexuality in chromosomes. Innateness of homosexuality, which makes it easier to accept yet supports homophobic politics, eugenics.
    * Social constuctivists: biological sex is a result of contingent processes of materialization as is gender.
* We have to dehetero-sexualize desire by separating sexual orientation from questions of identity and of gender roles.

## The Queer Critique of Normativity

Queer theory as a critique of identity and of identity politics taking on Foucault's analysis of the disciplinary purposes that sexual identities serve.

* Foucault: "Do not demand of politics that it restore the 'rights' of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power."
    * Skepticism of identity led to return to psychoanalysis as Freud's unconscious introduces a constitutive subjective division that undermines the possibility of any seamless identity.
    * Also led to historicism; the empiricist solution of investigating discrete social and cultura  practices.
    * Fantasy vs verbalization
        * Historicism takes hierarchy from fantasy which is found trivial, secondary, irrational. This hierarchy may be heterosexist in logic.

Queer vs normal, not queer vs straight.

* Principle challenge of queer theory is to confront the consequences of defining oneself against norms as such
    * Evaluative norms provide necessary criteria for evaluating the rightness and wrongness of an action or practive
    * vs normalizing norms which involve mechanisms of social reproduction and identity formation.
* Antisocial utopia of queer theory, protesting against the idea of normal behavior.
    * This does not involve the loneliness of psychosis but suggests alternate forms of community and of social ties.

## Lacan's Critique of Normativity

Lacan denounces the normalizing brands of psychoanalysis that aspire to scientific status: a form of analysis that boasts of its highly scientific distinctiveness gives rise to normative notions.

Queer politics can be regarded as quintessentially American. At the same time un-American, against individualism as it finds expression in the normalizing ethos of "adaptation to reality" that ego psychology promulgates as the goal of psychoanalytic therapy.

* Lacan: reality is imaginary. Psychology transmits ideals, ideals are society's slaves.
    * Ego comes into being through projective idealization -misrecognitions of images of the other-, the ego is a precipitate of idealized models.
    * Reality is sum of models and norms.
* Alternative order: the real which resists adaptation. The real has more to do with sex and death than the imaginary or the symbolic. We should think of sexuality in terms of the specific modes of the cultural images' and discourses' failure, in terms of their limits in determining human sexuality.
    * Real resonates with queer in its subversive sense (non-substantial).
    * The premature emergence of sexuality splits sexuality off from reality and reassigns it to the domain of fantasy.


## The Problem of Perversion

Lacan does not align homosexuality with perversion, which he conceptualizes in terms of an unconscious structure of desire. "The pervert" reinscribes a typology of desire and categories of personhood that Freud's account of perversion outmoded.

Freud: Sexuality is constitutively perverse, irremediably queer. 

* Perversion is the norm.
* Perversion precedes the norm -heterosexual genital reproductive- so normal sexuality is a falling away from perversion.
* Normal sexuality is both an ideal goal and the loss of an ideal state of polymorphous perversity.
* Freud: pathological perversion is only when there is "exclusiveness and fixation"
    * Normalizing is pathological since it fixes desire. It involves wrenching the metonymy of desire into the metaphor of the ego.
    * Homosexuality is also normalizing but not socially normative since its exclusionary.
        * Also antinormative since it expresses some aspect of desire: it is incompletely assimilable to the ego.

How to impersonalize desire so as to retain its originary perverse force without plunging into sexual anarchy?

## The Impersonality of Desire

Hocquenghem - dehumanization of desire.

* French antihumanism: the death of man as a master of his world because master of himself. Instead, man as the conduit for and product of nonhuman forces.
    * Loss of mastery = unconscious.
    * De-ego-ization - the obsolescence of a conception and ideology of the self.
* Deleuze and Guattari, anti-Oedipus, "good" and "bad" Freud
    * Desire is the hero, Oedipus is the villain.
    * Repressive structuring of productivity of desire in oedipal triangle of the nuclear family dynamics.
    * Partial objects as parts of desiring-machines
    * *"There is only desire and the social, and nothing else."*
* D & G revives radical insights of Freudo-Lacanian theory.

## The Repressive Hypothesis Redux

Deleuze and Guattari's critique of Lacan: three errors concerning desire
* Lack
* Law
* Signifier
    * Desire for desire permits no room for mediation -symbolic intervention.
        * Representation is always a social and psychic repression of desiring-production.
    * Machine: system of interruptions or breaks, serves mediating functions of the Lacanian symbolic.
    * D&G are against the symbolic order, they reject representation
        * Which brings them to accepting the repressive hypothesis,

Freud: perversion is internal, rather than opposed, to the normal.

* The queer fissures the normal from within.
* As soon as perversion or queerness becomes ontologized as an identity, perversion loses its disruptive potential
    * "The pervert" should always be barred.
        * The pervert does not exist

We escape the repressive hypothesis when perversion is thought as relational rather than substantive.

* D&G can't, because they foreclose necessary mediation categories (fantasy).
    * They stay in repression/liberation.
    * Like Foucault, they favor concrete, literal, positivist real concepts instead of a theory of fantasy.
    * Fantasy formula, many possible relations between subject and a, the object of the subject of the unconscious.

## The Ideology of Lack

D&G: "Desire does not lack anything".

* Lacan: "desire is the relation of being to lack".
* D&G: the subject is missing in desire, displace lack from the object to the subject, who is decentered by desire.
* Queer theory, D&G, are skeptical of lack because of the way institutionalized psychiatry treats homosexuality as lacking and the theological origin of lack (man is lacking, God is not).

Queer theory: theorizing desire not in terms of lack but of *excess*.

* D&G: desire is productive instead of reproductive, operates within a calculus of abundance rather than scarcity, multiplicity rather than singularity.
* pluralism

Lacan's theory can also explain desire as multiple, and thus pluralistic.

* Unconscious; excess of meaning.
* Loss: loss of mastery due to excess of significaiton.
* Object a vs the phallus: phallus implies a univocal model of desire, object a implies multiple, heterogeneous possibilities for desire.
* Partial object, polymorphous perversity, erogenous zones: come into being as soon as sexuality is separated from organic functions in the reflexive moment of auto-eroticism
    * Result of a cut (object a).
    * Freud: sexuality originates in this movement that breaks the connection to other people rather than establishing connection.
* Object choice is secondary; personification functions as a strategy of normalization.

## Sexuality versus Genitality

Erotogenicity can be in all parts of the body.
* "Sexual" is not reducible to "genital"
* Lacan: genital orifices represent displaced or secondary analogues for the mouth.
    * Mouth is multivalent as a site of entry and exit.
    * Inside meets outside
    * Organ of speech, desire involves language as well as the body.

D&G's criticism of Freud: subordinating multiplicity to unity.
* Total form of the ego as a libidinal object.
* As the surface by means of which the ego is projected, the skin loses its permeability, its porosity, and thence its potential for multiplicity.


Lacan: language's effect on the body gives rise to fantasy, decomposes imaginary unities into fragments (a), multiplying desire's possibilities.
* De-ego-ization entails not chaos since it follows a certain logic.


## The Queer Logic of Fantasy

Freud inherited a distinction between fantasy and imagination from 19th century German idealism.
* Kant: imagination as an active faculty of synthesis, aesthetic imagination is unfettered by the laws of association that govern cognition since imagination follows a higher law or logic of its own.
* Subordination of fantasy to imagination concerns a capacity for synthesis.
* The logic of the privileged faculty adheres to a logic distinct from those of positivist science.
* Freud's unconscious fantasy designates a new mode of reality- psychical reality. This aligns with Lacanian Real.
* Imagination - synthesis, fantasy (Real) -disintegrating force resisting efforts at assimilation and domestication.
* Freud: psychical reality mediates our access to mundane reality, cannot be completely separated.
* Fantasy is not individual, the subject of fantasy can be social, national.
    * Fantasy: dimension of sociality -the Other- inhabits the innermost, ostensibly private zone of the subject.


1919 study of beating fantasies; the person having the fantasy is not immediately identifiable as either the child being beaten or the one doing the beating.

Freud's three phases of the fantasy:
* 1. Conscious: My father is beating the child (whom I hate)
* 3. Conscious: A child is being beaten (I am watching)
* 2. Unconscious: I am being beaten by my father.
* Only the form of this phantasy is sadistic; the satisfaction which is derived form it is masochistic.
    * Shift from sadism to masochism accomplished grammatically by the transformation from an active to a passive construction.
    * Fantasy is not antithetical to verbalization. The logic of fantasy is that of verbalization.
    * Fantasy impersonalizes the subject, decomposing his or her ego in the mise-en-scene of desire and permits identifications across a number of socially regulated boundaries, undermining distinctions of social categories which can only provide grounds for imaginary identities.

Subjective mobility.
* Utopian: fantasmatic identification furnishes raison d'etre for sympathies and allegiances that might remain unaccountable.
* The operation in fantasy allows for multiplicity
* Constrained by the logic and laws of language.
* Unlike object relations or cultural studies which see fantasy as imaginary, in Lacan it involves all three orders.

Object a does not belong unequivocally to any of the three orders.

## The Triump of Love

Lacan's model for subjective loss is not the phallus, but feces (ungendered object).

* Turd > phallus
*  Object a is not material object, it designates an absence or loss for something which material objects function as both the prototype and the imaginary fulfillment.
* Anality is not pre-symbolic because the Other is already present.
    * The turd, leftover, is a problem of disposal. It being a problem implies that the body is already caught up in the symbolic network.
* Freud/Lacan: the child's relation to shit involves the object a (sexual stimulation) and the big Other (means of communication).
* Symbolic prohibition begins with anal sexuality.

Sexual difference is secondary:

* Desire emerges before sexual difference through the anal object, there is no a priori gendering of the object-cause of desire.


Triumph of love entails a kind of "mental work" that overrides shame, disgust, horror, or pain and is identified as specifically queer.

Freud: the aobject of desire is not another person, but something more abject.

* Person entails sublimation, idealizing consolidation of the object, rather than the idealization of the instinct in necrophilia and coprophagy.


# Conclusion - The Ineluctability of Sublimation

Sexuality is only partly historical: its other dimension has to do with the unconscious and with Lacanian real.

* Historical explanations of sexuality remain too tied to commonsensical psychological notions of personhood and gender to account for the radical impersonality of desire.
* Even though sexuality is part of everybody's experience, a fundamental aspect remains inaccessible to experience (unconscious).

Freud: everything involves excitation of the sexual instinct. Everything is sexual?

* Expansion of the sexual beyond the genital: jouissance.
* "Beyond sexuality": conceptual move beyond genitality, heterosexuality, and beyond identity politics.
    * Queer politics is beyond sexuality since it concerns itself with dimensions of exclusion that are seen as connected to sexuality, though they are not themselves sexual.
    * Going beyond sex as the truth of our being (Foucault's criticism of psychoanalysis commenting on Reich).

Desire involves an object a- not a person and prior to gender.

* Impersonal desire, human infant relates to its mother as an object, not a person.


Freud: sublimation away from genitalia, towards art.

* Art as sexual
* Relationality, relating to other persons only by way of mediating relationships with nonhuman forms.
* Jacques Alain Miller: the primary status of jouissance is not sexual
