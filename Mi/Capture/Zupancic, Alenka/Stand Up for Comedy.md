# Stand Up for Comedy

1:30    [[@Angela Nagle]]: populist right taking the side of transgression, the left taking the conservative side, defending order and introducing more rules.
5:10    The thing that makes the difference has shifted
5:30    over-valorization on affects: infantilization of the society, appeal to social authority
6:30    affects as social capital
10:30    Comedy as social form allows for dealing with impulses/ideas we don't want to think about and repress
11:00    [[@Sigmund Freud]]: joke works with resistances, its technique gives us pleasure and breaks through resistance.
12:30    Two forms of resistance: 
	1. I more or less agree with what is said but resist it due to external (cultural) causes and appreciate it when someone says it wittingly.
	2. I find the content inadmissible, not just its expression. (*Verdr√§ngung*) repressed content.
14:10    Beyond a public/private duality, repression of the second form takes place in immediate spontaneous reactions and feelings.
16:00    [[@Sigmund Freud]]: Source of morality is not moral. Repression is more effective than 'moral' source.
17:00    price of repression morality is discontent in civilization
18:00    [[@Jacques Lacan]]: ethics not based or fed by repression, other ways of dealing with impulses. These impulses are contradictory in themselves, even without the social restraints.
19:15    [[@Sigmund Freud]]: culture is a solution to the conflicts and contradictions of impulses but culture also produces conflicts
19:40    neo-liberal left proposes more culture against discontent of culture, more precise cultural regulations. 
20:20    exclusion of all manifestations of desire and enjoyment from public space
20:40    the populist right makes a cut between two laws; divine laws vs cultural laws which are artificial, inhibiting freedom. (displacing discontent into the second kind)
22:30    both avoid the question of repression
23:30    left introduces more levels of repression (rules, sub-rules) which the right jumps on because the populist strategy allows for expressing discontent at certain times.
24:35     comedy is a **collective-forming** practice. Comedy gives me ideas and deals with impulses with a different kind of pleasure (thinking as enjoyable practice)
26:00     **sublimation**, [[@Sigmund Freud]]: satisfaction of drives without repression taking place. comedy and philosophy can function as **gay science**.
27:40     stand up and sit back comedy: difference is what they do with individual/social repressions
- **sit back comedy** consolidates and cashes in on our repressions.
	- irony as drawing the line between us who get it and the others who don't get it. Establishes place of the stupid other.
	- you can never be on the wrong side, so 
32:30    you enjoy being right (mainstream left)
33:40    **stand up comedy**; attempting to win the audience, raking risk and convincing.
- makes the audience stand up in their heads
38:30    trump says what's on his mind so I don't have to say what's on my mind
41:30    Sacha Baron Cohen building a mosque in Arizona
- liberal blackmail: freedom of choice between green A and blue A
	- keep dreaming alternatives within the choice I impose upon you
- 'there is no dream mosque' as a response to systemic blackmail
