Monsters, Queers, and Hitchcock's Rebecca

By Rhona J. Berenstein

What sort of person do men marry?

Why isn't the girl of that sort?

Queer subtext aligned with monstrosity
* Case: Queer "frightening to look at, desiring, as it plays its own organ, producing its own music."
* Same-sex components of the lesbian and bisexual desires exhibited by *Rebecca*'s heroines.

Displacing the desire between women onto the level of the supernatural --- Gothic romance.
* Gothic--- ambiguity, hesitation between two possible interpretations of events by the protagonist.
    * Does Maxim love the girl or not?
    * Ambiguous representation of Rebecca

Rebecca as a force that mediates the primary heterosexual couple.
* Opening scene, Rebecca is ocean.
    * "Rebecca haunts this scene as an absent signifier of failed heterosexual matrimony."
* Rebecca's physical absence is palpable, "lurks in the blind space of the film"
* Rebecca's monstrosity established by descriptions as 'creature', 'devil', and linked to her abnormal body.
* Manderley is the space that is her; Rebecca embodies it.
    * Girl --- Manderley is like Girl --- Rebecca.

Opening dream scene:
* Rebecca's affinity with Manderley and nature personified.
    * She possesses a destructive and monstrous link to the forces of nature.
* Girl and Rebecca coupled
    * "Like all dreamers, I was possessed of a sudden, supernatural power and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me."
    * I â†’ we

Rebecca and queerness:
* Abnormal reproductive system (not pregnant but grows tumor)
* Confession to Maxim on cliff, unrepeatable.
* Her sexuality is unutterable.
* Man hater in the book.
* Favell is 'decadent dandy'

Rebecca is ambiguous model of femininity:
* Reveals the girl's unfulfilled desires, she is what is missing from the marriage.
* Aligned with masculinity
* Rebecca master masculine, the girl subordinate masculine male child.

Fragmentation of the girl's desires:
\1. For romantic coupling with Maxim

\2. For familial union with Max as a father figure and Rebecca as idealized mother.
* Female oedipal drama in which the girl must vanquish the maternal rival to take up her position within an oedipal scenario with her husband/father.
\3. Romantic desire for Rebecca, for an absent female body.
* "The desire for the mother as a sexual object impedes the progress of the heterosexual union."
	* Queer desire is displaced from the daughter onto the bad mother (Danvers).
        * Bisexual spectatorship
    * The girl leaves this by "trying to make her desire mirror the man's desire."
        * Replicating the first wife

Danvers loves Rebecca.
* Danvers is the queer who lures unsuspecting victims into her state of perversion: the homo that recruits.
* Substitutes Rebecca's body for the girl's in Rebecca's room.
