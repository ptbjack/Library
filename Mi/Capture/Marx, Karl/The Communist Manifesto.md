# Introduction
- A manifesto needs to make us feel inadequate for not having recognized these truths ourselves and inspire humanity for authentic freedom in order to succeed.
- Marx & Engels were describing the world after 1991: in order for the world they predicted to be real, in order for capital to globalize fully, the regimes that pledged allegiance to the Manifesto had first to be torn asunder.
- Constantly revolutionizing instruments of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty.
	- Then it was the steam engine, now it is artificial intelligence and automation.
	- This disturbance forces us to face up to how pathetic our relations with one another are.
- The ultra-rich are guilt-ridden and stressed; they are incapable of enjoying their riches because they are unfit to rule, cannot provide wage-slaves a reliable existence.
- [[Capitalism]] is insufficiently evolved to survive the technologies it spawns.
- Error of Marx & Engels; insufficient reflexivity, they failed to consider over the impact their own analysis would have on the world they were analyzing.
- Today, we don't need sermons on the injustice of it all, or denunciations of rising inequality. The *Manifesto* promotes clear-headed assessment of capitalism.
- [[Capitalism]] is irrational; fails to make rational use of the brilliant machines it engenders.
- The trick is to help speed up capital's development while resisting its tendency to steamroll over our human spirit.
# I. Bourgeois and Proletarians

Modern society has simplified the class struggle: whereas in feudalism or medieval times there used to be a gradation of classes, today, there is only the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

The modern bourgeoisie itself is the product of a long course of development, series of revolutions in the modes of production and exchange. 
- discovery of America, 
- industrial revolution, 
- guilds → manufacture → industry

The executive of the modern State is a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

Bourgeois, revolution:
- Bourgeoisie has put an end to imaginary relations between people; it resolved personal worth into exchange value.
- instead of numberless freedoms, only a single freedom of Free Trade, freedom to exploitation.
- Contrary to previous industrial classes, the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and with that, the whole of society.

Bourgeoisie gives a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption everywhere.
- Both material and intellectual production
- Creates a world in its own image, nations are compelled to become bourgeois societies because the prices are cheap.

Bourgeoisie has agglomerated production and concentrated property, leading to political centralization.

Epidemic of over-production is unique to modern bourgeois society.

In proportion as the bourgeoisie is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat (modern working class) developed.

The less the skill and strength implied in labor, the more it is generalized to women, but they are all instruments of labor in the end.
- differences of age and sex no longer have any distinctive social validity for the working class.

Sections of ruling class are precipitated into the proletariat, they supply enlightenment and progress.
- a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, esp. bourgeois ideologists.

The proletariat alone is a [[Revolutionary Class]]
- The other classes fight the bourgeoisie for survival, they are conservative, reactionary.
- The social scum ([[Rabble]]) are prone to be part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.
- All previous historical movements were that of minorities; the proletarian movement is the self-conscious and independent movement of the immense majority.

In its form, the struggle of the proletariat is a national struggle: the proletariat of each country must first settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.

Bourgeoisie is unfit to be the ruling class in society because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery.
- Previously, oppressing classes gave the oppressed class conditions to survive. 

# II. Proletarians and Communists

Communists vs working-class parties:
1. Communists point out the common interests of entire proletariat, independent of nationality.
2. Communists represent the interests of the movement as a whole.

Communists have clear understanding of the line of march, conditions and general results of the proletarian movement.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists express actual relations springing from an existing class struggle.

**Property**:
- The distinguishing feature of Communism is the abolition of bourgeois (private) property.
	- NOT all property
- development of industry has already destroyed self-earned property (of petty artisan and small peasant)
- Modern bourgeois form, property is based on **the antagonism of capital and wage-labor**:
	- Capital is a social power: it can be set in motion only by the united action of all members of society.
		- When capital is converted into common property, it loses its class-character.
	- Minimum wage is for the subsistence, bare existence of the laborer. We need not abolish this, only its miserable character.
- Private property is already done away with for nine-tenth of the population.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.

Freedom:
- Bourgeois conditions: free trade, free selling and buying. These have no meaning opposed to Communistic abolition of buying and selling.

Abolition of family:
- the bourgeois family is based on capital, private gain. It exists only among the bourgeoisie and is complemented by the absence of family among the proletarians and public prostitution.

Community of women:
- Bourgeois sees in wife only an instrument of production.
- Women are already privately and publicly exploited in the system.

Ideas that revolutionize society are the elements of a new society within the old one, that they are already there.

# III. Socialist and Communist Literature
## 1. Reactionary Socialism
### A. Feudal Socialism
French and English aristocrats wrote, formulating their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone.
- French legitimists
- "Young England"
- In showing that the modern proletariat did not exist under their rule, they forgot that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.
### B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism
Uses the standard of the peasant and betty bourgeois, immediate classes. 
Points out the contradictions in the conditions of modern production but is reactionary and Utopian in its positive aims.
### C. German, or "True," Socialism
Germans annexed French revolutionary literature, but without the social conditions, it became a universal discourse rather than that of particular class.
- the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified to them the law of pure Will.
## 2. Conservative, or Bourgeois, Socialism
Economists, philanthropists, humanitarians desire to redress social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society.
- Wants all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles resulting therefrom: **they wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat**.
- e.g. Proudhon's *Philosophie de la Misere*
- the bourgeois is a bourgeois - for the benefit of the working class.

## 3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism

They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favored.
They reject all political and revolutionary action.
