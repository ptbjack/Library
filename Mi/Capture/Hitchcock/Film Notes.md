## EXTRA

1966 Interview - Mike Scott:**
Narrative titles + spoken titles: juvenile comments illustrated
Title designer

*The Lodger* - German influence
Commercial movies; the goal is to appeal as much an audience, but do not degrade the film.
'Chase story'; having a film star.

*The Lodger* - glass floor; man pacing

*The Ring* - boxing: topicality of it.
American film training, influence
* Hollywood style exaggerated rooms
* 
*Blackmail *\- first sound film (took to it as a duck takes to a quack)
* Counterpoint of sound
    * "The voice should never make the same statement the face is making."
"Actors of cattle."
"All the drama on the set, not on the screen."

*Murder* - Only who-done-it: no emotion
* Prefer suspense film - apprehension
Film star has advantage: the audience worries about him
Character as average man in bizzare situation

*39 Steps*
"Moronic logic" of americans asking weird questions (of children asking their parents)

*Man Who Knew Too Much* - famous locations
* Audience knows about them
* Location is not background
Suspense: Audience has all the information
Fascination for the macabre:
* The violent understated
Handcuffing, tying up; sexual symbolism
1936, *Secret Agent *didn't succeed because the hero's objective is negative.
* Audience had no interest.

*Sabotage* - mistake of exploding the bomb

*Young and Innocent*, twitching eye (letting the audience in on it)

## 1969 Interview

Dreams are not blurred, used Salvador Dali for sharp lines.
Discovering the sexual in the woman.
*North by Northwest* plane chasing scene, born out of wanting to avoid cliché
*Psycho* is black and white because the draining of the blood would be too repulsive.
