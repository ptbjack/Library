**Zizek - Reality of the Virtual**

Virtual = Reality, real effects, by something that does not fully exist.

# Imaginary, symbolic and real virtual

Imaginary virtual: we erase somethings of the person from the image we are interacting with. Image has reality, structures the way I am dealing with you.

Symbolic virtual:
- Authority; in order be exercised, has to remain virtual (threat). If direct, it is experienced as impotence.
* Beliefs; presupposed, nobody has to believe for belief to structure reality.
	* E.g. Christmas, Democracy

Real virtual:
* Imaginary real: traumatic images, too strong to be perceived.
* Symbolic real: quantum physics (resists symbolization). It works but resists consistent ontology. Functioning, meaningless machine.
* Real Real:
     * Obscene shadow of the symbolic.
     * E.g. marching chants in the military: meaningless rhymes combined with obscenity.
     - *The Sound of Music*: narrative reality vs virtual texture 
        * Rumsfield:
            * `known known`: the fact that Saddam is president
            * `known unknown`: how many weapons Saddam has we don't know
            * `unknown unknown`: unexpected weapon of Saddam
            * Add `unknown known`: we don't know we know them.
                * unconscious
        * Attractors in physics: the shape which doesn't exist in itself, an abstract form structuring elements around it.
            * E.g. Trauma in Freud: 
                * First, a dense presence of some real which intrudes into symbolic space and curves it.
                * Then, traumatic scene is resuscitated when the curvature of the symbolic space (antagonism, imbalance) is confronted.
        * Politics: class struggle comes first (symbolic space is curved, imbalanced). In order to account for it, we invent the figure of the Jew.
            * Alternative modernity: antagonisms in modernity are not part of the concept of modernity, but a historical particular of modernity. What if there could be alternative modernities?
                * Anybody can have his own modernity.
                * Historicist nominalism ("there is no modernity as such, only particular modernities")
                * Antagonism is reduced to a particularity
                * We already had alternate modernities (e.g. fascism). Didn't work.
            * Opposing it: there is antagonism in the very universal notion of modernity.
                * Modernity as a notion names a deadlock, particular attempts are attempts to solve it.
                * Universality is the sight of antagonism (virtual)
        * Real as purely formal (non-substantial, structural gap)
            * *Pure difference:* difference that is prior to what it is a difference between (the terms appear afterwards to cover up the tension of this difference).
                * E.g. Left and Right
                * E.g. sexual difference
            * Purely formal materialism of the difference.
                * Primordial fact is pure, self difference.
                * Multitude is an effect of the inconsistency of the One itself.
                    * Binary signifier is primordially repressed, second element is always missing.
            * Kant: Negative vs infinite judgement.
                * You aren't human vs you are inhuman.
                * Infinite judgement: affirming a non-predicate.
                * Freedom: neither nature nor culture.
                    * Symbolic prohibitions try to dominate inhuman excess (ex-timate kernel of humanity).
            * Politics of pure difference:
                * NOT identity politics, of recognizing the differences.
                    * Logic of their struggle is that of recognizing differences: each identity having freedom to deploy itself.
                * Universality is not an encompassing container of positions, it is that of the struggle itself.
                    * Position of struggle not that of a particular identity, abandoning universal truth.
                    * There is universal truth of a situation, accessible only through a partial position.
                * Notion of collective; universality accessible to engaged, subjective position.
        * the real of the super-ego injunction to enjoy:
            * Old ethics: moderation.
            * New ethics: of limitless consumption, no moderation. The object in itself is deprived of danger (decaf coffee).
                * Tolerance of avoiding harassment, intolerance of coming too close.
                * Ulrich Beck: "Humanitarian militarism": wars for peace
            * Psychoanalysis: today, you feel guilty if you cannot enjoy.
                * Double function of psychoanalysis:
                    * (1) Badiou: learn to become a pitiless censor of yourself. Opening up a space in which you are allowed not to enjoy.
                    * (2) reinventing utopia: not exercise in free imagination.
                        * Immediately enacted, when there is no other way.
                        * Doing what appears impossible.
                        * Practicing utopias.
