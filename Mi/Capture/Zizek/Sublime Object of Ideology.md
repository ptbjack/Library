# Preface: The Idea's Constipation?

* When a discipline is in crisis,
    * *Ptolemization*: attempts to change or suplement its theses within the terms of its basic framework.

 E.g. 'string theory', which claims to provide the foundations for a unified theory, but we are still waiting for a new beginning which will radically change basic presuppositions.

'Copernican' revolution*: the basic framework itself undergoes a transformation.
* What about psychoanalysis?
    * Cognitive sciences say Freud is a ptolemization of classical psychology.
    * Zizek is trying to save psychoanalysis, a discredited theory, by reference to an even more discredited theory, Hegel's dialectics.
* Hegel's *sublation* *Aufhebung* of all immediate-material reality. 
    * After Reason does its abstraction and fixing work, the immediacy of Life is lost.
    * Hegel praises the exercise of the force of Understanding, absolute power, the action of separating the elements.
    * But, Understanding does not reflect into sublation and take it to the end, it externalizes it and is merely the power of our imagination, does not concern the reality of the thing.
    * Understanding → Reason; the power of tearing apart is displaced from merely our mind to things in themselves, as their inherent power of negativity. 
    * School self-portrait experiment: from Hegelian perspective, shift from colorful immediacy of life to all gray conceptual structure is indication of crucial spiritual progress.
    * Hegel: understanding does determination and gives varieties of the sensuous a rigidity of being, spiritually animates and sharpens them.
    * Lacan -referring to Freud-, simplification to **le trait unaire**, single dominant characteristic that predominates, simple determinations of thought from blurred actuality.
    * Dialectical approach is usually understood as bringing the phenomenon to a totality and linking it to other things. But, this is a trap. According to Hegel, we already see too much in something to be analyzed. The problem is to abstract from them and grasp only the notional determination.
    * Reduction to the signifying trait unaire contrasts actuality to possibility.
        * Possibility is not multitude of a thing's actual properties reduced to its 'true reality'--- it is inner potential.
        * We reach this potential through the lenses of a language. E.g. 'Chair' is because I want to or am able to sit on it.
* Notion of Hegel's system a devourer that swallows every object it comes upon: conceiving/grasping is a sublimated version of digestion?
    * Hegel: If individual human being achieves something, this fact must be grounded in the way the thing itself, in its concept, acts and behaves: If I am able to eat apple and destroy its organic self-identity, the apple contains, in advance, the determination of being subject to destruction.
    * Critics of Hegel paint is as constipated Substance-Subject, retaining within itself the swallowed content. 
        * How about shitting? Is the subject of 'absolute knowledge' not also an emptied subject, reduced to the role of pure observer of the self-movement of the content itself?
        * The subject is the substance reduced to the void of empty form of self-relating negativity, emptied of all the wealth of 'personality'
            * Lacanese: substance → subject == S → $ (subject is the barred substance)
            * At the end of *Logic, *the Idea 'freely releases itself' into Nature, lets Nature go, discards it. Philosophy of nature is not a violent re-appropriation of externality, it involves the passive attitude of an observer. Philosophy has to watch how nature itself sublates its externality.
                * E.g. God releasing himself to temporality in Christ
                * E.g. nature mort paintings, subjectivity no longer needs the visual medium as its principal means of expression - shift to more direct presentation of the subject's inner life.
        * Shitting is the immanent conclusion of eating, abrogation follows sublation, otherwise there would be endless process of sublation.
            * *Abrogation* is a sublation of sublation, the movement of suppression and preservation produces this transformation at a certain moment of Absolute Knowledge.
            * True cognition is not only the notional appropriation of its object, its completed when it liberates its object, lets it be. 
* Isn't what is dropped that which can be afforded to be dropped - the passing aspect of the object in the process of notional mediation/reduction? NO:

1. The discarded/released is the manure of spiritual development, the ground 		out of which further development will grow - the foundation of Spirit proper.

 2. The object of cognition, once dropped, no longer needs the subject's active intervention, develops itself following its own conceptual automatism.
 - The subject is reduced to passive registrar. Hegelian cognition is both active and passive. 
 - Kant: subject actively synthesizes the content by which he is passively affected. 
 - For Hegel, at moment of Absolute Knowledge, the subject is passivized. The agent of the process is the System of knowledge itself, deploying itself automatically without the need for external pushes. 
 - At the same time, self-erasure in particular content as the agent intervening in the object requieres the greatest activity.
 - Hegel overcomes the dualism between System (Spinoza *deus sive natura* 	of which I am a part, caught up in its determinism) and Freedom (Fichte:  	 						subject is the agent opposed to inert matter, trying to dominate and  	 					appropriate it): the supreme moment of the subject's freedom is to set  							free its object, to leave it free to deploy itself.
    * Schelling's criticism that Hegel could not make the passage from abstract thought to real life, only could do by employing terms of the will and practical life such as 'decision'. But, releasing the other is immanent to the dialectical process.
    * Hegel's third syllogism of Philosophy: Spirit-Logic-Nature: speculative movement starts from the spiritual substance into which the subject is immersed, and the subject reduces the wealth of the substance to its underlying logical/notional structure, then the fully developed logical Idea can release Nature out of itself. 
* No transformation (subjective Notion becoming objectivity etc) occurs in this freedom. Hegel: absolute liberation is different from the standard dialectical transition. How? Hegel seems to rely on the absolute mediation of all otherness: "I set the Other free only after I have completely internalized it". Really?
    * Hegel might be positing a division that runs through the particular subject as well as through the universal substantial order of 'collectivity', uniting the two.
        * Basic postmodern reproach to Hegel: dialectics admits antagonisms and splits only to resolve them magically in a higher synthesis-mediation.
        * Vs Marxist reproach: Hegel resolves antagonisms in thought, while in reality they remain unsolved.
        * What if the point is not to resolve antagonisms in reality, but simply to enact a parallax shift so that antagonisms are recognized 'as such' and perceived in their 'positive' role?
            * Kant → Hegel: ontological proof of God's existance
                * Kant: being is not predicate, one cannot conclude a being from a notion. I can have a perfect notion of God but God still may not exist.
            * Hegel: 
                * being is the poorest notional determination -everything 'is' in some way. We get to existence through further notional determinations.
                * The gap between notion and existance is precisely the mark of finitude. Existence holds for finite objects but not for God. 
            * Hegel vs Kant seems like idealism vs materialism - Kant insists on minimum materialism as the independence of reality with regard to notional determinations, while Hegel dissolves reality in its notional determinations.
            * But, Hegel's point is a radical materialist claim that a complete notional determination of an entity (complete notional determination + being = existence) is in itself an abstract notion, an empty abstract possibility. The lack of a being is an inherent lack of some notional determination.
            * Hegel to Anselm's proof: not conceptual enough.
                * Anselm: God is sum of all perfections, so its beyond our comprehension as finite human minds - presupposes God as impenetrable reality outside notional domain, God is not a concept but a purely presupposed pre- or non-conceptual reality.
                * Things exist not when they meet certain notional requirements, but when they fail to meet them - material reality is a sign of imperfection.
                    * Truth of a proposition is inherently notional, not a matter of comparison between notion and reality: truth is non-All, there is no external limitation/exception measure or standard. Criterion of truth is immanent. 
    * Nature is not the exception that guarantees the Wholeness of the Idea's self-mediation. The completed Idea does not need an external Other (Nature) to sustain the complete and closed circle of its self-mediation. Nature is the mark of the non-All of the Idea's totality.
* Hegelian dialectical process is process without a subject - there is no ultimate subject pulling the strings. 
# Introduction

* Post-structuralism: Althusser-Lacan debate is replaced and substituted by Habermas-Foucault debate. It is not that Althusser's school is theoretically defeated, more like Habermas is traumatized by it and has to repress it.
    * Habermas' ethics of unbroken communication, the Ideal of the universal and transparent intersubjective community has a notion of the subject of transcendental reflection.
    * Foucault: every subject must build his own mode of self-mastery and invent himself -produce himself as subject-. Like the subject of Renaissance, as the power of self-mediation and harmonizing the antagonistic forces, as a way of mastering the use of pleasures through a restoration of the image of self.
    * Althusser: a certain mis-recognition characterizes the human condition as such: the idea of the possible end of ideology is an ideological idea par excellence. Heroism of alienation/subjective destitution: We must accept this mis-recognition as unavoidable.
        * The process of ideological interpellation implies a certain short circuit of the type 'I was already there'.
    * Lacan: ethics of separation. We must not obliterate the distance separating the Real from its symbolization, keep the object-cause of desire. We must acknowledge a fundamental antagonism of a kernel resisting symbolic integration-dissolution.
        * Marxist social antagonism: (1) there is a fundamental antagonism of ontological priority to 'mediate' all other antagonisms (class antagonism). (2) historical development brings about an 'objective possibility' of solving this fundamental antagonism. 
            * The revolutionary moment is when everyone realized that everyday totality and everyone's battles cannot be fought without resolving fundamental antagonism of capital. The only real solution is to be found in global revolution, which will abolish basic social antagonism, enabling the formation of a transparent, rationally governed society.
        * Post-Marxism: any kind of antagonism can take the priority; feminist fundamentalism, democratic fundamentalism etc.
        * Lacanian psychoanalysis: this plurality of antagonisms are a multitude of responses to the same impossible-real kernel.
        * *'Death drive'* is a blind automatism of repetition beyond pleasure-seeking, self-preservation, accordance between man and is milieu. It is a dimension of radical negativity -the parasite of reason, language-. We have to come to terms with it and try to articulate a *modus vivendi* with it.
            * All culture is a reaction-formation, an attempt to cultivate imbalance, the traumatic kernel, through which man cuts his umbilical cord with nature. The aim is not to abolish this drive antagonism, but the aspiration to abolish it is the source of totalitarian temptation (holocaust perpetrated in the name of New Man without antagonistic tension)
            * Ecology- man is wound of Nature, you cannot remove the fissure but you try as far as possible to patch things up afterwards.
            * Democracy- it is not good, but there is nothing better right now. You cannot try to restore pure democracy without falling into totalization. 
                * Laclau & Mouffe acknowledge an original trauma, an impossible kernel which resists symbolization. Every solution only postpones fundamental impossibility. We can save democracy only by taking into account its own radical impossibility.
        * Marxism: the global solution-revolution is the condition of the effective solution of all particular problems
        * Lacan: every provisional, temporary solution of a particular problem entails an acknowledgment of the a fundamental antagonism.
* Best model for acknowledgement of fundamental antagonism is Hegelian dialectics, a systematic notation of the failure of progressive overcoming.
    * Hegel's reconciliation is not a sublation of all reality in the Concept but a final cosent to the fact that the Concept itself is non-All.
* Aims of this book:
    * Introduction to Lacan, his break from post-structuralism, locating him in rationalism.
    * Return to Hegel through Lacanian reading.
    * Contribute to the theory of ideology via a new reading of well-known, classical motifs and crucial Lacanian concepts.
# I The Symptom
## 1 How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?
### Marx, Freud: the analysis of form

* How did Marx invent the symptom -a notion which applies also to the analysis of dreams, hysterical phenomena, etc.- in his analysis of the world of commodities?
    * Fundamental homology between the interpretative procedures: the point is to avoid the properly fetishistic fascination of the content, the secret is the form.
        * Freud: why did the latent dream-thoughts assume the form of a dream?
        * Marx: why did work assume the form of the value of a commodity?
* Paradox in Freudian approach to dreams: the desire articulated in a dream is supposed to be unconscious and at the same time of a sexual nature. Most of his cases are not sexual or unconscious. 
    * Reproach -Eysenck- is based on a fundamental theoretical error: the identification of the unconscious desire at work in the dream with the 'latent thought' - the signification of the dream.
    * There is nothing unconscious in the latent dream-thought. The thought can be articulated in the syntax of everyday language; belongs to the system of consciousness/preconscioussness, subject is aware of it. Under certain conditions, this thought is pushed away, translated into the '*language of the unconscious*'.
        * The essential constitution of dream is not its 'latent thought' but the work which confers on it the form of a dream: mechanisms of *displacement and condensation*, the figuration of the content of words or syllables.
        * The normal -unpleasant- thought is drawn to towards the unconscious because it achieves a 'short-circuit' between it and another desire which is already repressed, a desire which has nothing to do with the 'latent dream-thought'. 
            * Unconscious wish derived from infancy and in a state of repression, has been transferred to a normal train of thought.
    * Unconscious/sexual desire does not originate in the normal language of everyday communication - its place is in the mechanisms of the 'primary process'.
    * Constitutively repressed [Urverdrängung], not symbolic
    * Three elements at work in the structure:
        * (content) *Manifest dream-text*: rüyanın content'i, already-symbolized ve 'dillendirilmiş'
        * (content) *Latent thought*: rüyanın tabirini yaparak ulaşılmaya çalışılan şey.
    * Isn't temporally prior to manifest content, only logically prior.
    * Lacan could say that it does not exist.
        * (form) *Unconscious desire*: mechanism that translates latent thought into manifest content. Articulated in the dream - its only place is the form of the dream, the real subject matter of the dream articulates itself in the dream-work.
* Freud's two stages:
    * First, get away from thinking dreams are meaningless confusion that have nothing to do with signification by going towards hermeneutic approach. Concieve the dream as a meaningful phenomenon, somehing transmitting a repressed message.
    * Then, get rid of the fascination in this kernel of signification, in the 'hidden meaning' of the dream and center attention on the form itself, on the dream-work.
* Marx's two stages:
    * First, break from the appereance of the value of commodity depending on pure hazard -e.g. accidental interplay between supply and demand-. We must concieve the signification 'expressed' by this form.
    * Classical political economy is interested only in contents concealed behind the commodity-form (like hidden content of dreams), it cannot explain the secret of this form itself.
* We must take a step to analyse the genesis of the commodity-form itself: Why is labour expressed in value? Why the measurement of labour by its duration is expressed in the magnitude of the value of the product?

### The unconscious of the commodity-form

* Marxian analysis of the commodity-form presents a matrix enabling us to generate all other forms of the *'fetishistic inversion'*, a pure version of a mechanism offering the key to the theoretical understanding of phenomena that does not seem to have anything to do with commodity-form.
    * Alfred Sohn-Rethel: the formal analysis of the commodity holds the key to the historical explanation of the abstract conceptual mode of thinking and of the division of intellectual and manual labour which came into existence with it.
        * The structure of the commodity-form holds the transcendental subject, it articulates the advance in the skeleton of the Kantian transcendental subject (network of transcendental categories which constitute the a priori frame of 'objective' scientific knowledge.
        * The apparatus of categories presuppoed by the scientific procedure is already present in the social effectivity, already at work in the act of commodity exchange. 
            * Before thought could arrive at abstraction, abstraction is already at work in the social effectivity of the market. Double abstraction in exchange of commodities:
                * The abstraction from the changeable character of commodity during the act of exchange:
        *  The commodity could undergo any number of material changes but we fix the value at one abstract moment (?)
        * A = A
                * The abstraction from concrete, sensual, particular character of commodity. In the exchange, the particular qualitative determination of a commodity is not taken into account; a commodity is reduced to abstract entity -regardless of its usefulness- posesses 'the same value' as another commodity for which it is being exchanged.
        * A = B
            * Before quantitative determination, basis of science of nature, pure quantity is already at work in money as the commodity which renders possible the commensurability of the value of all other commodities notwithstanding their particular qualitative determination.
    * Thus, the transcendental subject (support of the net of a priori categories) is confronted with the disquieting fact that its formal genesis comes from a pathological (contingent, historical) process. The ontological status *'real abstraction'* (the act of abstraction at work in the very effective process of the exchange of commodities) is very similar to the unconscious (this signifying chain which persists on 'another Scene'): the 'real abstraction' is the unconscious of the transcendental subject, the support of objective-universal scientific knowledge.
        * The object-commodity does not contain 'value' in the same way it possesses a set of particular properties (taste, color, form etc.)
            * Sohn-Rethel: its nature is that of a postulate implied by the effective act of exchange. An '*as if*':
                * During exchange, individuals proceed *as if* the commodity is not submitted to physical, material exchanges
                * *As if* it is excluded from the natural cycle of generation and corruption.
                * E.g. money: we behave as if money is an immutable substance, over which time has no power. *Fetishistic disavowal*: 'I know that money is a material object like others, but still it is *as if* it were made of a special substance over which time has no power'.
                    * Sublime material of money/ body within the body of the *sublime object*, postulated existance depends on the symbolic order: the indestructible 'body-within-the-body' exempted from the effects of wear and tear is always sustained by the guarantee of some symbolic authority.
                        * E.g. the bank replaces old/worn banknotes.

        * The exchange abstraction is not thought, but it has the form of thought (not thought by any subject, exchange requires abstraction). The 'real abstraction' has nothing to do with 'reality', of the effective properties of an object and it is not 'thought-abstraction', as a process taking place in the interior of the thinking subject.
    * Possible definition of *the unconscious*: the form of thought whose ontological status is not that of thought, some Other Scene external to the thought whereby the form of the thought is already articulated in advance.
        * Unconscious: the topology of the signifying chain, how signifiers are tied to each other.

        * Also *symbolic order* is such: a formal order which supplements/disrupts the dual relationship of 'external' factual reality and 'internal' subjective experience.
            * Althusser doesn't recognize this form of thought coming before thought, he sees abstraction only in the domain of knowledge.
            * Between 'real object' and 'object of knowledge', third element which subverts the field: the form of thought previous and external to thought- symbolic order.
                    * Althusser doesn't recognize symbolic order.

        * Sohn-Rethel's confrontation: philosophical reflection is thus subjected to ancanny experience: the external effectivity of the exchange process, is your proper place.
            * Philosophy is defined by blindness to that place of exchange.
            * That place is also complemented by blindness to 'real abstraction'. Individuals are practical solipsists, and misrecognize the socio-synthetic function of exchange. If they took note of 'real abstraction', the 'effective' act of exchange would not be possible.
        * The misrecognition bring the fissure of the consciousness into 'practical' and 'theoretical', practical solipsist and universal Reason towards an observation of nature.
            * The social effectivity of the exchange process is a reality whose ontological consistency implies a certain non-knowledge of its participants - if we know too much, to pierce the true functioning of social reality, this reality would dissolve itself.
            * = fundamental dimension of *'ideology'*: it is not an illusory representation of reality but this reality itself is already to be conceived as 'ideological'. It depends on participants not knowing its essence.
            * = dimension of *symptom* - a formation whose very consistency implies a certain non-knowledge on the part of the subject. The subject can 'enjoy his symptom' only in so far as its logic escapes him - the measure of the success of its interpretation is its dissolution.

### The social symptom

* Marxian symptom: detected a fissure, an asymmetry, a certain 'pathological' imbalance which belies the universalism of the bourgeois 'rights and duties'. This imbalance functions as a constitutive moment and does not point to an insufficiency to be abolished by further development.
* *Symptom* is a particular element which subverts its own universal foundation, a species subverting its genus.
    * Elementary Marxian procedure of 'criticism of ideology' is already 'symptomatic': it consists in detecting a point of breakdown
        *  *heterogenous *to a given ideological field
        * And at the same time *necessary* for that field to achieve its closure, its accomplished form.
    * The procedure implies a logic of exception for every ideological Universal such that they are false in so far as they necessarily include a specific case which is heterogenous to others -breaks the unity- and lays open their falsity.

        * E.g. freedom: a universal notion including multiple species (of press, of speech, of commerce) but also, by necessity, a specific freedom of the worker to sell freely his own labour on the market. This specific freedom subverts this universal notion - as opposite of effective freedom: by selling his labour 'freely', the worker loses his freedom - the real content of this free act of sale is the worker's enslavement to capital.
            * This specific freedom (paradoxical) closes the circle of 'bourgeois freedoms'.
        * E.g. ideal of the market: 
            * in the pre-capitalist society, the production of commodities has not yet attained universal character and there is artisan production: the proprietors themselves work and sell their products on the market.
            * When production for the market prevails, another commodity of labour force is produced: workers sell their labour instead of the products of their labour.
            * With labour force as commodity, equivalent exchange becomes its own negation- appropriation of surplus value. There isn't only a simple violation of equivalent exchange, the exchange between labour and capital is equitable etc. But labout force is peculiar commodity which produces surplus value appropriated by the capitalist. 
            * Marx: utopian socialism is universality without its symptom: there is universalized relations of exchange, and production for the market, but workers are not exploited.
        * Marx's critique of Hegelian society as a rational totality: we need to include in a rational totality a paradoxical element which functions as a symptom; for capitalist society it is the proletariat, the unreason of reason itself.

### Commodity fetishism

* Lacan locates the invention of the symtom in Marx's conception of the passage from feudalism to capitalism.
* First, we look at *commodity fetishism*:
    * = a definite social relation between man, that assumes in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things: the value of a commodity -an insignia of a network of social relations between producers of diverse commodities- assumes the form of a quasi-natural property of money, another thing-commodity. 
    * There is a misrecognition that concerns the relation between a structured network and one of its elements, monetary value seems as an immediate property of one of the elements that belongs to it outside its relation with other elements.
        * The value of commodity A expressed in commodity B where the body of B becomes for A the mirror of its value. 
        * This misrecognition also happens in relations between men as it happens in relation between things: Peter, for whom "I am I" is not enough (as it is for Fichte), recognizes himself in other men.
            * Lacanian mirror stage: ego arrives at self-identity in so far as another man offers it an image of its unity, identity and alienation are strictly correlative.
    * Fetishism: the appereance is such that: A seems to relate to B as if, for B, to be an equivalent of A would not be a 'reflexive determination' of A, as if B would already in itself be the equivalent of A, being equivalent appears on the same level as its other 'natural' effective properties.
        * Between man: being-a-king is an effect of network of social relations, but for the subject, it appears that the king is already in himself, outside of the relationship to his subjects, a king. Being-a-king seems his natural property.
    * Two levels of fetishism: between things and between man. In capitalist society, there isn't a fetishism between man, in exchange, each individual is 'free', driven by egoistic interest, there is no veneration of the Master.
        * Two levels are incompatible: if there is commodity fetishism, no fetishism in relations between man (master and slave). In pre-capitalist society, commodity fetishism is not developed because there is no production for the market.
    * Feudalism → capitalism, Master is displaced into things, master-slave is replaced by commodity fetishism.
* The symptom arises in feudalism → capitalism when the relations of domination and servitude are *repressed*
    * Hysterical symptom: the social relations between individuals are disguised under the shape of social relations between things.
    * What is repressed returns as a symptom

### Totalitarian Laughter

* The dialectics of commodity fetishism can help us understand 'totalitarianism':
    * Something wrong with* Name of the Rose*:
        * Its ideology is spaghetti structuralism - there is no final reality, we all live in a world of signs referring to other signs.
        * Thesis: the source of totalitarianism is a dogmatic attachment, the lack of laughter, especially exerted in the name of the supreme Good.
        * ≈ enlightened version of religious belief: if you become too obsessed with the Good and with a corresponding hate for secularism, your obsession with Good may turn into a force of destructive hatred and Evil.
            * Its inverse is more disquieting: persistence on Evil may turn you into an ethical hero (Don Giovanni's persistance in not renouncing his Evil makes him a hero)
                * Ethical hero because he acts beyond the *pleasure principle* (which wants him to renounce and get salvation) and follows his desire.

        * Underlying belief in the anti-totalitarian force of ironic distance.
    * In contemporary societies, cynical distance is part of the game. 
    * Taking its ideology seriously is the most dangerous for totalitarianism.

### Cynicism as a form of ideology

* Ideology (Marx) = they do not know it, but they are doing it
    * Constitutive naiveté, the misrecognition of its own presuppositions and a distance between so-called social reality and our distorted representation -false consciousness- of it.
        * Aim of the critical procedure is to lead the naive ideological consciousness to recognize the social reality it is distorting and through this act dissolve itself.
    * Frankfurt School: the main point is to see how the reality itself cannot reproduce itself without this so-called ideological mystification, distortion is written into the very essence of social reality.
        * The paradox of a being which can reproduce itself only in so far as it is misrecognized and overlooked.
* Does the classical concept of ideology as a naive consciousness still apply to today's world?
    * Sloterdijk: ideology's dominant mode of functioning is cynical, which renders impossible the classical critical-ideological procedure.
        * = they know very well what they are doing, but still, they are doing it.
    * Kynicism ≠  cynicism
        * Kynicism exposes behind the sublime noblesse of the ideological phrases the egotistical interests.
            * It is pragmatic, not argumentative. It subverts official proposition by confronting it with the situation of its enunciation and proceeds ad hominem.
        * Cynicism takes into account the particular interest behind the ideological universality, but still finds reasons to retain the mask.
            * 'Negation of the negation' of the official ideology
    * Adorno: ideology is a system which makes a claim to the truth, pretends to be taken seriously. Totalitarian ideology no longer has this pretension. It is just a means of manipulation, purely external and instrumental. It's rule is secured by simple extra-ideological violence and promise of gain.
    * Cynical reason leaves untouched the fundamental level of ideological fantasy, the level on which ideology structures the social reality itself.

### Ideological fantasy

* In the classical Marxian formula of ideology, where is the illusion? In the *knowing* or *doing*?
    * At first sight, in the knowing: the discordance between what people are doing and what they think they are doing.
    * In commodity fetishism, money is just an embodiment, a materialization of social relations. To people, the function of money seems as immediate. Marx: we must notice the social relations behind the things. 
        * Where is the distortion?
        * On an everyday level, individuals *know* that there are relations between people behind the relations between things.
    * The problem is that in what they are *doing* is the immediate embodiment of wealth as such. They are fetishists in practice, not in theory.
    * Marxian motive of speculative inversion of the Universal/Particular:
        * The Universal is a property of particular objects which really exist.
        * In commodity fetishism, concrete content of a commodity (use-value) is an expression of its abstract universality (exchange-value). The Universal (Value) appears as a real Substance which incarnates itself in a series of concrete objects.
            * Like a Hegelian subject-substance; a Universal going through a series of particular embodiments.
            * The bourgeois individual
                * Is not Hegelian idealist: does not concieve the particular content as resulting from an autonomous movement of the universal Idea
                * Is nominalist: the Universal is a property of the Particular - of existing things. But in practice, acts as if the particular things (commodities) were just so many embodiments of universal Value.
* *Ideological fantasy*: overlooking the illusion which is structuring our real, effective relationship to reality.
    * Cynical distance is one way of blinding ourselves to the structuring power of ideological fantasy. Even if we do not take things seriously, even if we keep an ironical distance, we are still doing them.
        * E.g. they know that their idea of Freedom is masking a particular form of exploitation, but they still continue to follow this idea of Freedom. 

### The objectivity of belief

* Althusserian reproach to Marxian commodity fetishism is based on a naive, ideological, epistemologically unfounded opposition between persons and things. Lacanian reading:
    * Feudalism, relations between people are mystified, master and slave.
    * Capitalism, people are emancipated from mystifications but beliefs are embodied in the social relations between things: the things themselves believe for them. Belief is exterior, embodied in the practical, effective procedure of people.

 ≈ Tibetan prayer wheel: I am praying through the medium of the wheel. Whatever I am thinking, objectively I am praying.

* Lacan: psychoanalysis is not psychology, beliefs and emotions can be delegated to others without losing their sincerity.


 ≈ The chorus in Greek tragedy: in the audience, I may be worried about everyday problems and may not be able to feel the required emotions, but the Chorus feels for me. 

 ≈ The laugh track in television: it relieves us of the duty to laugh. The Other is laughing instead of us. Even if we just stare at the TV set, we can say afterwards that objectively, through the medium of the other, we had a really good time.

### Law is Law

Belief is not an 'intimate', purely mental state, and is always materialized in our effective social activity: it supports the fantasy which regulates social reality.

* Kafka's universe is criticized to be exaggerated, fantastic expression of modern bureaucracy and the fate of the individual. But this exaggeration articulates the fantasy regulating the libidinal functioning of the 'effective', 'real' bureaucracy itself.
* The analytical approach aims at the ideological fantasy efficient in social reality itself.

Social reality is an ethical construction, supported by an *as if*. As soon as belief is lost, the texture of the social field disintegrates.

* Pascal: interiority of reasoning is determined by the external, nonsensical 'machine' - the automatism of the signifier, of the symbolic network in which the subjects are caught.

* Lacan:* unconscious *is the automaton which leads the mind unconsciously with it.
    * We must obey the Law not because it is just, good, or beneficial but *because it is the Law*: the foundation of the Law's authority lies in its process of enunciation.
    * = symbolic order / Other

The only real obedience is external. Obedience out of conviction is mediated by subjectivity: we are not really obeying the authority but following our judgement, which tells us that the authority deserves to be obeyed in so far as it is good, wise, beneficent.

* Kierkegaard: only the act of belief itself can give us an insight into Christ's goodness and wisdom.
    * We do not believe because we have found sufficient good reasons to believe, we find reasons attesting our belief because we already believe.
* 'External' obedience is not submission to external pressure, but obedience to Command in so far as it is incomprehensible, not understood.
    * Traumatic, non-integrated character of the Law is a* positive condition* of it.
        * Fundamental feature of *superego*: it cannot be integrated into the symbolic universe of the subject.
            * Experienced as senseless injunction
            * Superego = mechanism of guilt, we are demanded to enjoy, we have to enjoy.
        * It is a contingent character: the process of enunciation of the Law must be repressed into the unconscious through the ideological, imaginary experience of the 'meaning' of the Law, of its functionality/truth/justice.
        * What is repressed is that its authority is without truth.

The necessary structural illusion is **transference**: this supposition of a Truth, of a Meaning behind the stupid, traumatic, inconsistent fact of the Law.

* The reasons why we should believe are persuasive only to those who already believe.

* Pascal: wager on God: leave rational argumentation and submit yourself simply to ideological ritual, act *as if* you already believe, and the belief will come by itself.
* French communists' wager: bourgeois intellectuals recognize their impotence, 	cannot accept sense of history because of class passions. They learn to subdue petty-bourgeois passions and prejudices. They imitate working class, become good Marxists making contribution to the noble Cause.
* *Belief before belief*: external custom is material support for the subject's unconscious.
* E.g. *Another Country*: 
    * Judd is a Communist -openly declared renunciation-, Guy is a hedonist homosexual.
    * Judd is the point of Guy's transferential identification. Two reasons:
        * Guy catches Judd in his inconsistency, in his lack.
        * Guy reveals Judd's transference with Marxism: "you are not a Communist because you understand Marx, you understand Marx because you are a Communist!"
        * At first, these two seem like reasons why Guy liberates himself from transference with Judd, but
            * Lacan: 'Those in the know are lost' -transference is already at work.
    * Guy's indiscretion is his mask - coincidence of mask and the truth- but it is impossible to keep up, successful communication requires a minimum distance between appearence and its hidden rear.

### Kafka, critic of Althusser

The external, symbolic machine ('automaton') is the place where the fate of our internal beliefs is in advance staged and decided. We already believe unconsciously.

* Unconscious is radically exterior. 

* Belief is an affair of obedience to the dead, uncomprehended letter (signifier).

    * Dead letter = *objet petit a*


Althusser failed to think out the link between Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs) and ideological interpellation: how does the ISAs (the signifying automatism) 'internalize' itself; how does it produce the effect of ideological belief in a Cause and the interconnecting effect of subjectivation, of recognition of one's ideological position?

* The external 'machine' of ISAs exercise its force only in so far as it is experienced in the unconscious economy of the subject, as a traumatic injunction.
* Internalization of ideology is never complete, there remains a traumatic left over (*symptom*), which does not hinder the full submission of the subject to the ideological command, but is the condition of it. 
    * Non-integrated surplus sustains ideological* jouis-sense* (enjoyment-in-sense) proper to ideology.

Kafka made a critique of Althusser *avant-le-lettre, *showing the constitutive gap between 'machine' and its 'internalization'. Subject is confronted by ISAs before any identification or subjectivation takes place.

* Interpellation without subjectivation: subject does not understand the meaning of the call of the Other (e.g. the beginning of the Trial) but interpellation works without identification (Josef K. Recognizes the call of the Other and chases the meaning behind the call, goes to trial etc.)
* Interpellation = symbolic identification
    * Subject ($) is trapped by the Other by a paradoxial object-cause of desire in the midst of it (*a*).
    * Lacanian *formula of fantasy*: $♢*a*
        * Ideological fantasy structures reality.
        * Between drama and reality, fantasy is on the side of reality.
        * Lacan's interpretation of 'burning child' dream
            * Usual interpretation: dream tries to prolong sleep. When the person senses exterior stimulus (smell of smoke), dream constructs a scene/story that includes this element. When the stimulus is too strong, the person wakes up.
            * Lacan: the thing that he encounters in the dream is the reality of his desire -his fundamental guilt as father- and he wakes up to escape the Real of his desire.
                * 'Reality' is a fantasy-construction which enables us to mask the Real of our desire.
                * = ideology, is not an escape from unbearable reality but a fantasy-construction which supports 'reality' and masks some insupportable, real, impossible kernel (Laclau/Mouffe: antagonism, traumatic social division which cannot be symbolized)
        * Zhuang Zi; dreams of being a butterfly, wakes up and thinks, "what if he is a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuang Zi?" This question is justifiable:
            * The question proves that Zhuang Zi is not a fool. A fool is someone who believes in his immediate identity with himself, incapable of dialectically mediated distance towards himself -a king who thinks he is a king as a natural property of his being-.
            * Zhuang Zi is not void of all possible content, there isn't radical alienation of the subject, he is not only what the symbolic order offers him. He has possibility to obtain positive contents outside the alienating symbolic network
                * Through fantasy: equating the subject to an object of fantasy (butterfly)
                    * $♢*a - *Zhuang Zi / Butterfly
                    * Butterfly is any object that is put over *objet petit a*.
                * In the symbolic reality he was Zhuang Zi but in the Real of his desire he was a butterfly.
            * Dialectical split is possible only when he is awake.

### Fantasy as a support of reality

Lacan: it is only in the dream that we come close to the Real of our desire.

* This doesn't mean that 'life is just a dream' etc.
* Lacanian thesis: there is a hard kernel, a leftover which persists and cannot be reduced to a universal play of illusory mirroring. The only point at which we approach this hard kernel of the Real is the dream.
    * Ideological dream: we cannot throw away ideological glasses and break out of the ideological dream - we remain throughout 'the consciousness of our ideological dream'.
    * The only way to break out of the ideological dream is to confront the Real of our desire which announces itself in this dream.
    * E.g. Antisemitism:
        * It is not enough to say that we must liberate ourselves from 'anti-Semitic prejudices' and see the Jews as they really are. 
        * We must confront ourselves with how the ideological figure of the Jew is invested with our unconscious desire, how we constructed this figure to escape a certain deadlock of our desire.
        * Even is an objective look would confirm that Jews financially exploit other populations and they do sometimes seduce our daughters, this has nothing to do with the real roots of antisemitism.

 ≈ jealous husband: even if all the facts he quotes in support of his jealousy are true, this does not change the fact that his jealousy is a pathological, paranoid construction.

  * This objective approach would confirm unconscious prejudices with additional rationalizations.

* The ideological figure of a Jew is a way to stitch up the inconsistency of our own ideological system.
    * We cannot escape ideology by juxtaposing the everyday existance, pre-ideological level. An ideology is successful when we feel no opposition between it and everyday reality. 

### Surplus-value and surplus-enjoyment

Difference between Marx and Lacan/Freud:
* Marx: the ideological gaze is a partial gaze overlooking the totality of social relations
    * Lacan: ideology designates a totality set on effacing the traces of its own impossibility.
* Marx: a fetish conceals the positive network of social relations
    * Freud: a fetish conceals the lack 'castration' around which the symbolic network is articulated.
* Marx: ideological procedure is that of false eternalization/universalization: the interests of a particular class disguises itself as universal human interest. The aim of the 'criticism of ideology' is to denounce this false universality.
    * Lacan: the most 'cunning' ideological procedure the very opposite of externalization: *an over-rapid historicization*. 
        * E.g. marxist-feminist criticism of psychoanalysis:
            * pyschoanalysis insists on the crucial role of the Oedipus conplex and the nuclear family triangle.
            * This insistance transforms a historically conditioned form of patriarchal family into a feature of universal human condition.
                * "Historically conditioned" evades the hard kernel - the Real of the Law, the rock of castration.
            * If over-universalization produces a blindness to its historical, socio-symbolic determination, over-rapid historicization makes us blind to the real kernel which returns as the same through diverse historicizations/symbolizations.
            * E.g. concentration camps: reducing them to product of a concrete social order (Fascism, Socialism) is attempt to elude the fact that we are dealing with the 'real' of our civilization which returns as the same traumatic kernel in all social systems.

Surplus-enjoyment comes from surplus-value:
* Marx: the limit of capitalism is capital itself, i.e. the capitalist mode of production
    * Historicist-evolutionist reading of the formula:
        * Follows metaphor of the serpent which from time to time sheds its skin, which has grown too tight.
        * The productive forces (often reduced to technological development) are limited by relations of production which are replaced by social revolution with new relations.
        * In Marx's reading, formal subsumption precedes the real one: Capital first subsumes the process of production as it found it, and subsequently changes the productive forces step by step.
            * Form drives content
        * The evolutionist reading cannot answer when the capitalist relation of production becomes an obstacle to the further development of the productive forces.
            * Previous modes of production had moments of contention and contradiction between relations and productive forces, but for capitalism, the contradiction is contained in its very concept in the form of the contradiction between the social mode of production and the individual, private mode of appropriation.
                * This contradiction propels capitalism to permanent development, inner contradiction drives it.
* Enjoyment is constitutively excess. 
    * We lose enjoyment if we substract excess

 ≈ Capitalism cannot exist if it loses that internal contradiction and the incessant revolution of its own material conditions.

 Surplus-value is the 'cause which sets in motion the capitalist process of production, *surplus-enjoyment* is the object-cause of desire.

## 2 From Symptom to Sinthome
### The Dialectics of the Symptom
#### Back to the future

The symptom as a 'return of the repressed'. Initially appears as a trace and will not be understood until the analysis has got quite a long way.

Analysis as a symbolization (early Lacan), symbolic integration of meaningless imaginary traces.

* Implies imaginary character of the unconscious.
    * Made up of imaginary fixations which could not be assimilated to the symbolic development of the subject's history.
    * Something that will be realized in the Symbolic, or
    * Something that will have been.

Symptoms return from the future:

* Their meanings are constructed retroactively.
* The analysis produces the truth, the signifying frame which gives the symptoms their symbolic place and meaning.
    * Within the symbolic order, the past is always present in the form of historical tradition and the meaning of these traces changes continually with the transformation of the signifier's network - with every advent of a new *master-signifier (S1)*.
* We suppose in advance the presence of a knowledge in the other - *transference*.
    * This knowledge is a necessary illusion, we can only elaborate it by means of the illusion that the other already possesses it and that we are only discovering it.
    * Transference = actualization of the reality of the unconscious, there is a gap between languange and subject, dependence on the big Other for meaning.
        * (Language is not transparent, is based on assumption that there is meaning)
    * (The other is also language, there is no outside of transference)

The past exists \{==as it is included in the synchronous net of the signifier==\}\{\>\>We imagine the past to be diachronic, subjected to time, has before and after, but it exists in the language as synchronous, there is always retroactivity at work.\<\<\}, as it is symbolized in the texture of the historical memory. We are rewriting history all the time, retroactively giving elements their signifying weight.

* The symptom is an effect that precedes its cause: working through the symptom 'brings about the past', we produce the symbolic reality of the long-forgotten traumatic events.


**Transference** is an illusion which we cannot bypass to reach directly for the Truth, the Truth itself is constituted through the illusion proper to the transference.

* Lacan: {==Truth==}{>>Is not positive, it is the recognition of a misrecognition, it is where our symbolic order falls apart<<} arises from misrecognition.
* The basic paradox of transference:
    * The subject is confronted with a scene from the past that he wants to change, to intervene in.
    * He takes a journey to the past, intervenes in the scene.
    * Only through his intervention does the scene from the past become what it always was: his intervention was from the beginning included.
    * E.g. the myth of Oedipus: Oedipus and his father are communicated the prophecy and they try to evade it, their attempt ends up fulfilling the prophecy.

#### Repetition in History

Subjective mediation of time: The subjective 'error', misrecognition, arrives paradoxically before the truth in relation to which we are designating it as 'error', because the truth itself becomes true only through (Hegel: by mediation of) the error.

* = the logic of the unconscious 'cunning'
    * Unconscious is not unattainable thing, it is an overlooking (*une bévue*). We overlook the way our act is already part of the state of things we are looking at, the way our error is part of the Truth itself.
* E.g. Rosa Luxemburg:
    * Eduard Bernstein fears premature, impatient attempts at seizing power will hurt the revolution. He wants to wait for the right objective conditions to arrive.
    * Rosa: the first seizures of power are necessarily 'premature'. The working class has to educate itself for the objectively appropriate conditions through premature attempts. You can't sit around waiting for the right moment to come.
        * *The impossibility of metalanguage* in the revolutionary process: the revolutionary subject does not 'conduct' this process from an objective distance. The temporality of the revolution passes through subjectivity. We cannot make the revolution 'at the right moment' without the previous 'premature', failed attempts.
            * Hegel: revolution can succeed only as a repetition of a first failed attempt.
        * Difference between the obsessional (Bernstein) who is delaying, putting off the act, and the hysterical (Luxemburg) who overtakes herself in her act and thus unmasks the falsity of the obsessional's position.

Why the need for repetition?

* Caesar consolidated power and acted in historical necessity - the Republic was losing power and the only form of government to save it was a monarchy.
    * The Republic prevailed because 'she forgot that she was already dead'
* His consolidation seemed like a contingent act out of self-will. The 'opinion' which wanted to save the Republic saw that if Caesar was killed, the Republic would be restored.
* The conspiracy against Caesar attested the Truth of Caesar, the outcome of the murder was the reign of Augustus, the first *caesar*.
* The truth arose from failure: in failing, missing its express goal, the murder of Caesar fulfilled the task which was assigned to it by history.
    * To exhibit the historical necessity by denouncing its own non-truth -its own arbitrary, contingent character.
* The passage from Caesar (the name of the individual) to caesar (title of the Roman emperor) shows the problem of repetition.
    * An act through which breaks historical necessity is perceived by the consciousness (the 'opinion of the people) as arbitrary. 
    * The people try to do away with its consequences, to restore the old state of things.
    * When this act repeats itself it is finally perceived as an expression of the underlying historical necessity.
* Repetition is the way historical necessity asserts itself in the eyes of the 'opinion'.
    * This idea of repetition rests on the epistemologically naive presupposition of an objective historical necessity persisting independently of consciousness and asserting itself through repetition.
        * This idea loses the way historical necessity is constituted through misrecognition, through the initial failure of 'opinion' to recognize its true character.
            * Changed symbolic status of an event:
                * First, it is experienced as a contingent trauma/ intrusion of a non-symbolized Real
                * Through repetition, its symbolic necessity is recognized/ realized in the symbolic order.
            * E.g. to realize himself in his symbolic necessity, Caesar has to die as an empirical, flesh-and-blood personality, precisely because the 'necessity' is a *symbolic* one.
        * The misrecognition of its first advent is immediately 'internal' to the event's symbolic necessity, is a constituent of its final recognition.
            * The first murder (Caesar's parricide) opened up the guilt/debt, which was the driving force of the repetition. The event did not repeat because of objective historical necessity, but because its repetition was a repayment of our {==symbolic debt==}{>>Difference between what you want to say and what you say, what you want to be and what you are. Result of symbolic castration (objects are not signifiers).<<}.

Repetition announces the advent of the Law, of the Name-of-the-Father in place of the dead, assassinated father: the event which repeats itself receives its law retroactively, through repetition.

* Hegelian repetition as a passage from a lawless series to a lawlike series.


#### Hegel with Austen

Jane Austen is the only counterpart to Hegel in literature:

* *Pride and Prejudice* as the perfect case of the dialectic of truth arising from misrecognition.
    * Elizabeth -poor girl- and Darcy -rich guy- are attracted to each other. Darcy proposes and renounces Elizabeth's social class. Elizabeth refuses and renounces Darcy's arrogance in renouncing her class. After a while, they work through their misrecognition and become more in love. 
    * Double failure, mutual misrecognition, possesses a structure of a double movement of communication where each subject receives from the other its own message in the inverse form.
    * The failure of their first encounter, the double misrecognition, functions as a positive condition of the final outcome.
    * In the perceived deficiency of the other, each perceives the falsity of his/her own subjective position, the deficiency of the other is simply an objectification of the distortion of our own point of view.
        * Pride and prejudice are not immediate properties of the characters, they appear only from the perspective of the other.


#### Two Hegelian jokes

Hegelian joke:

    * The Pole asks the Jew "How do you strip everyone of all of their money?"
    * the Jew answers, "to learn it, you need to pay me 5 zloti" and continues asking for money. 
    * Finally the Pole says "There is no secret at all, you simply want to extract the last small coin from me!"
    * The Jew says: "now you see how we, the Jews..."
* The Pole is in transference from the beginning, the Jew embodies for him the 'subject presumed to know'
* The double movement of the outcome: the Jew delivers the secret through the simple deception that the Pole points out.
    * The Pole's error is in his perspective. The 'secret' is not at the end of narration, it is the narration itself, the Jew knows how to take our desire into account.
    * The dissolution of transference occurs when the Pole realizing how, through his deception, the Jew has kept his word.
* 'Secret' = *objet petit a*
    * The object causing our desire and it is posed retroactively by this desire.
    * In going through the fantasy we experience how this fantasy-object only materializes the void of our desire.

Door of the Law in *Trial*:

    * Dying man: "Everyone strives to attain the law, how does it come about that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?"
    * Door-keeper: "No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended only for you. I am now going to shut it down."
* The stake of the narration was only to capture his desire.
* Final twist follows the Hegelian logic of abolishing the 'bad infinity'.
    * The subject is confronted with substantial Truth which evades him *ad infinitum*.
    * The subject has to realize, from the very beginning, the door concealing the secret was meant only for him.
        * The external position vis-a-vis the Other is internal to the Other itself.
        * The very feature which seems to exclude the subject from the Other is already a 'reflexive determination' of the Other; precisely as excluded from the Other, we are already part of its game.
            * The gap between the subject and the Other is constitutive of the Other.


#### A time trap

The Door into Summer: *Man hibernating and waking up twice in 2001, during his second stay sees in the newspaper his name as the awakened.

* The apparent possibility that he might have seen his own name in his first stay is one of the excluded 'not possibles' on the basic circuit design of predestination and free will.
* The 'condition of the possibility' of the letter must be overlooked, its existence depends on its not being seen by the subject.

 ≈ the 'pre-ontological' status of the unconscious: the unconscious is a paradoxical letter which insists only in so far as it does not exist ontologically.

Knowledge is about the particular logic of his enjoyment. The subject refers to the objects around him as to some given positivity. Psychoanalysis shows how this given positivity exists and retains its consistency only in so far as somewhere else some fundamental non-knowledge (knowledge of the lack in the other) insists. 

* If we come to know too much, we may lose our very being. (ethical act, subjective destitution)
    * E.g.* imaginary self* which exists only on the basis of the misrecognition of its own conditions. The subject can pay for this reflection with the loss of his very ontological consistency.
    * We approach knowledge about the particular logic of our enjoyment and consistency, positivity of self dissolves.
* To abolish the misrecognition means at the same time to abolish the 'substance' which was supposed to hide itself behind the form-illusion of misrecognition.
    * 'Substance = *jouissance* (enjoyment = Real, mindless repetition.)
        * Access to knowledge (symbolic) is paid with the loss of enjoyment. Enjoyment is possible only on the basis of certain non-knowledge, ignorance, misrecognition.

### Symptom as Real
#### The Titanic as symptom

The dialectics of the symptom -of overtaking ourselves towards the future and simultaneous retroactive modification of the past- has its limits: **the Real**: the traumatic point which is always missed but none the less always returns, although we try to neutralize it and integrate it into the symbolic order.

* The symptom is conceived as the real kernel of enjoyment which persists as surplus and returns through all attempts to domesticate it, to dissolve it by means of putting-into-words its meaning.


*Titanic*'s sinking was a shock but this sinking arrived at its proper time, 'the time was waiting for it', even before it happened, there was a place reserved for it in fantasy-space (novel about Atlantic liner *Titan* published in 1898)

* It was already part of the Zeitgeist that a certain age of defined class distinctions and peace was coming to an end.
* The Atlantic liners were {==the ego-ideal==}{>>Should be ideal ego?<<} of society: well-working complex machine, microcosm of the social structure.
* *Titanic*'s impact is because of its symbolic overdetermination. It was read as a 'symbol', a metaphorical representation of the approaching catastrophe of European civilization itself.
* Looking at the footage of the wreck is still powerful. It's power does not come from representation (its metaphoric over determination) but from a certain inert presence.
    * Titanic is a *Thing*: a material leftover, the materialization of the terrifying, impossible* *jouissance**. Visible fragments are a remnant of the liquid flux of *jouissance*, a kind of petrified forest of enjoyment.
    * Its meaning is permeated by enjoyment:* jouis-sense*.
    * The wreck is a *sublime object*: a positive material object elevated to the status of the impossible Thing.
* We try to escape the terrifying presence of the Thing by trying to give it meaning: the meaning obscures the terrifying impact of its presence.

#### From symptom to sinthome

Almost everything that is becomes in a way symptom. (universalization of the symptom in late Lacan)

* Lacan is criticized for not considering the existence of the world in the triangle world-language-subject. 
* Lacan's answer: The world doesn't exist, language doesn't exist, subject doesn't exist.
    * The big Other does not exist

* What does exist?
* Lacan: the symptom.
    * The fundamental gesture of post-structuralism is to deconstruct every substantial identity, to denounce behind its solid consistency an interplay of symbolic overdetermination.
    * The notion of symptom is the necessary counterpoint to this gesture. It is the substance of enjoyment, the real kernel around which this signifying interplay is structured.

Foreclosure:

* Originally, the exclusion of a key-signifier (point de capiton, {==Name-of-the-Father==}{>>For language: substitution of the signifier for the object<<}) from the symbolic order, triggering the psychotic process.
    * What was foreclosed from the Symbolic returns in the Real, e.g. hallucinatory phenomena.
    * Could be understood as symbolic castration
* Universal range to the function of foreclosure: whenever we have a symbolic structure it is structured around a certain void, it implies the foreclosure of a key-signifier.
    * E.g. symbolic structuring of sexuality:
        * Implies the lack of a signifier of the sexual relationship, sexual relation cannot be symbolized.
        * Articulation of an antagonism is: man + woman + a.

        * This lack returns as a symptom: {==woman is the symptom of man.==}{>>Woman as objet petit a
        * Man as the big Other<<}

Isn't 'symptom as real' against the thesis that the unconscious is structured like a language and that the symptom is a symbolic formation -a coded message which can be dissolved through interpretation because it is already in itself a signifier?

* Different conceptualization of symptom point to different stages in Lacan's development:
    * First, 1950s, a symptom is a symbolic, signifying formation, a coded message addressed to the big Other which later was supposed to confer on it its true meaning.
        * It is formed with an eye to its interpretation. There is no symptom without transference.
        * In psychoanalysis, the aim is to re-establish the broken network of communication by allowing the patient to verbalize the meaning of his symptom.
        * The symptom implies the field of the big Other as consistent, complete, because it is an appeal to the Other which contains its meaning.
    * Why does the symptom persist after its interpretation?
        * Lacan: enjoyment. The symptom is a way for the subject to organize his enjoyment.
            * Symptom and fantasy as opposites.
                * Symptom overtakes itself towards its interpretation, fantasy escapes analysis.
                * Symptom implies consistent big Other, fantasy implies an inconsistent big Other (tries to fill out a void in the Other).
                * Symptom (a slip of the tongue) causes discomfort when it occurs, but its intersubjective recognition causes intellectual pleasure. Fantasy (daydreaming) causes pleasure when it occurs but confessing our fantasies to others causes discomfort.
                * So two stages of psychoanalytic process: *interpretation of symptoms- going through fantas*y.
    * Why does the symptom persist after going through fantasy?
        * Lacan: {==sinthome==}{>>Something you are repeatedly compulsed to do<<}: a certain signifying formation penetrated with enjoyment. A signifier as a bearer of *jouis-sense*, enjoyment in sense.
            * Symptom as sinthome is our only substance: it is the way we avoid madness by choosing something {==(the symptom formation)==}{>>Subject as such is only symptom formation<<} instead of nothing (radical psychotic autism, the destruction of the symbolic universe -a case which does not exist, out of language etc.-) through the binding of our enjoyment to a certain signifying, symbolic formation which assures a minimum of consistency of our being-in-the-world.
        * Final definition of the end of psychoanalysis is identification with the symptom: the subject must identify himself with the place where his symptom already is, in its 'pathological' particularity he must recognize the element which gives consistency to his being.
* *Symptom*: a particular signifying formation, a binding of enjoyment, an inert stain resisting communication and interpretation, a stain which cannot be included in the circuit of social bond network, but is at the same time a positive condition of it.
    * Freud: women are unbearable but at the same time the best thing we have of their kind.
    * If woman does not exist, man is simply a woman who thinks that she does not exist.

#### In you more than yourself

In so far as the sinthome is a certain signifier which is not enchained in a network but immediately filled, penetrated by enjoyment, its status is by definition 'psychosomatic': a terrifying bodily mark which is merely a mute attestation bearing witness to a disgusting enjoyment, without representing anything or anyone.

* E.g. mark on child's body in Kafka's *A Country Doctor*
* E.g. Amfortas's suffering in Wagner's *Parsifal*: as long as his wound bleeds, he cannot die. He must do his duty and perform the ritual but Amfortas begs his attendants to have mercy on him and kill him.
    * Symptom: an element which causes a great deal of trouble, but its absence would mean even greater trouble: total catastrophe.

Ridley Scott's *Alien*:

* The cave they go into is the pre-symbolic Thing, of the maternal body, of the living substance of enjoyment.
* The parasite adhering to Hurt's face is a leftover of the maternal Thing which then functions as a symptom -the Real of enjoyment- of the group: it threatens them and at the same time constitutes them as a closed group.
* It changes shape -it is anamorphic surplus in the ship.
* The alien is the Real: doesn't exist on a symbolic level but at the same time is the only thing that exists in the film: it is the thing against which the whole reality is utterly defenseless.

Truth and enjoyment are radically incompatible: the dimension of truth is opened through our misrecognition of the traumatic Thing, embodying the impossible jouissance.

#### Ideological jouissance

There is always an inconsistency of the socio-symbolic Other, and the positive side of this inconsistency is obscene enjoyment.

The Lacanian criticism of the autonomous subject and his power of reflection, of reflexive appropriation of his objective condition is not an affirmation of some irrational ground escaping the reach of reason.

Capital is the limit of capitalism ≈ Enlightenment is the limit of Enlightenment.

* Enlightenment: "Reason autonomously! Do not accept anything without questioning its rational foundations, always preserve a critical distance..."
* Kant introduces a fissure into the heart of the Enlightenment project: "Reason about whatever you want and as much as you want - but *obey*!"
    * Addressing the enlightened public, you can reason freely, but _as part of the social machine_, you must obey unconditionally the orders of your superiors.
    * Descartes, obverse of the doubting *cogito* is 'provisional morality', a set of rules for survival in everyday existence. First rule is the need to accept and obey the customs and laws of the country we are born to without questioning their authority.
* Acceptance of customs is not pre-Enlightenment remnant, it is _the necessary obverse of Enlightenment itself_. Through this acceptance ('Law is law'), we are internally freed from its constraints- the way is open for free theoretical reflection.
    * The acceptance of non-founded customs entails a distance from them. They appear as nonsensical 'machine' that must be accepted as such.
    * There is no distance in pre-Enlightenment universe, the Law is illuminated by the charismatic power of fascination.
    * Looks like principal illusion of Enlightenment is: there seems to be space where inner reflection is spotless, unblemished by the externality of customs through the distance we keep from them.

Kant's categorical imperative (internal moral Law) is already truth-less, nonsensical. It is necessary, given fact which has unconditional authority.

* Kantian moral Law vs social laws:
    * Social laws structure a field of social reality, moral Law is the Real of the unconditional imperative, impossible injunction, which is indifferent to limitations imposed by reality.
    * Social laws pacify egoism and regulate social homeostasis, moral Law creates imbalance in this homeostasis by introducing an element of unconditional compulsion.
    * Kant's paradox: priority of practical over theoretical reason: we can achieve maturity proper to the autonomous subject by submitting to the irrational compulsion of the categorical imperative.
        * Lacan: categorical imperative conceals an obscene superego injunction: 'Enjoy!' - the voice of the Other impelling us to follow our duty for the sake of duty is a traumatic irruption of an appeal to impossible jouissance, disrupting the homeostasis of the pleasure and reality principles.
        * Obscenity is in the form itself, not the pathological remnants sticking to the pure form of the Law. Excluding and renouncing enjoyment (pathological content) produces a surplus-enjoyment (*plus-de-jouir*)
            * E.g. fascism: renounce enjoyment, obey because you must! Renounciation produces a certain surplus-enjoyment.

Surplus through renunciation is ***objet petit a, ***embodiment of surplus-enjoyment.

* Marx, surplus-value implies renounciation of 'pathological', empirical use-value.
* Fascism is obscene because it perceives the ideological form as its own end, as end-in-itself. It is utterly void, demands obedience and sacrifice for its own sake. The point is not the instrumental value of the sacrifice, it is the very form of sacrifice which is the cure against the liberal-decadent disease.
* Psychoanalysis enables us to locate an obscene enjoyment at work in this act of formal sacrifice.
* The real aim of ideology is the attitude demanded by it, the positive reasons are there to conceal the surplus-enjoyment proper to the ideological form as such.

Jon Elster: notion of states that are essentially by-products of our activity. As soon as we aim at these states, our procedure becomes self-defeating.

* E.g. Tocqueville's justification of the jury system: it is good for the people who have to decide the case as public education.
    * Elster: for public education to happen in jury system, people must believe that they are doing something that is worthwhile and important beyond their own personal development.
    * As soon as people become aware that the purpose of the system is public education and what they do has no real effect, this educational effect is spoilt.
* E.g. Pascal's wager: I choose to believe in God because even if there is no God, it will have beneficial effects for my terrestrial life.
    * In order for this effect to come up, I really have to believe in God.
    * Although the real stake of religion is the terrestrial profit achieved by the religious attitude, this gain is a state that is essentially a by-product and it can be produced only as a non-intended result of our belief in a religious beyond.
* E.g. Rosa Luxemburg: the first attempts at power are doomed to fail, their direct aims cannot be achieved. The balance sheet is positive because their main gain is educational - they serve the formation of the working class into the revolutionary subject.
    * If we say to the workers: "the main point of your struggle is its educational effect on you, it doesn't matter if you fail", the educational effect will be lost.
* Descartes: you have to be certain in a direction, walk in one direction even if your decision is based only on chance. This will lead you *somewhere* than nowhere.
    * This shows the hidden dimension of enjoyment in ideology. The real goal is the consistency of the ideological attitude itself which has to be hidden. The consistency is a by-product.
    * The aim is to justify the means.
    * Ideology serves only its own purpose, it does not serve anything - the Lacanian definition of *jouissance*.
# II Lack in the Other
## 3 'Che Vuoi?'
### Identity
#### The ideological 'quilt'

Floating signifiers are structured into a field through the intervention of a 'nodal point' (*point de capiton*) which 'quilts' them, stops their sliding and fixes their meaning.

* The 'literal' signification of floating signifiers depends on their metaphorical surplus-signification.
* Every element of an ideological field is part of a series of equivalences, its metaphorical surplus determines retroactively its very identity.
* Enchainment only possible on condition that a certain signifier -Lacanian 'One'- quilts the whole field.
* The first task of analysis is to isolate the particular struggle which at the same time determines the horizon of its totality (Hegel: the species which is its own universal kind)
    * How to formulate the determining role of a particular domain without falling into a trap if essentialism? (e.g. in Marxism the workers' struggle appears as the Truth of all the others)

#### Descriptivism versus antidescriptivism

Kripke's antidescriptivism is founded on the invasion of the body snatchers: it is diffucult to determine at the level of positive reality that surplus, that evasive feature, which differentiates them from all other people.

Descriptivism vs. Antidescriptivism: how do names refer to the objects they donate?

* Descriptivism: every word is the bearer of a certain meaning.
    * Intention (universal properties comprised in its meaning) has logical priority over extension (set of objects referred to by a word).
    * Emphasizes the immanent, internal 'intentional contents' of a word
* Antidescriptivism: word is connected to the object by an act of 'primal baptism'.
    * The external causal link, the way a word has been transmitted from subject to subject in a chain of tradition, is decisive.
    * If archaeologists found fossils that correspond to properties that belong to 'unicorn', we would not say that there were unicorns.
        * Fulfillment of desire: when we encounter in reality an object that satisfies the properties of the fantasized object of desire, we are necessarily disappointed, experience a 'this is not it'. This object in reality cannot be the reference of desire.

#### The two myths

Both positions miss the crucial point that naming is radically contingent. Both have to invent a myth to construct an agency guaranteeing its necessity:

* Descriptivism, Searle:
    * Lacan: language is intersubjective, there is no private language. It must be a part of the meaning of each name that it refers to a certain object because this is its name: every name implies a self-referential, circular movement.
        * Stupidity in names: a name refers to an object because this object is called that -impersonal form announces the dimension of the 'big Other' beyond other subjects.
        * Misses the dimension of the big Other
* Antidescriptivism, Donnellan's myth of an 'omniscient observer of history'
    * The guaranteeing of the identity of an object in all possible situations is the retroactive effect of naming itself.
    * The 'surplus' in the object which stays the same in all possible worlds is the Lacanian *objet petit a*, it has no positive consistency- the objectification of a void.
    * The achievement of antidescriptivism is to enable the conception of objet a as the real-impossible correlative of the 'rigid designator': the *point de capiton* as 'pure' signifier.

#### Rigid designator as object

The effect of quilting occurs only when a certain inversion takes place: the point de capiton is not a rich signifier. 

* E.g. Marlboro: in order for the cowboy to become the signifier of a certain image of America, real Americans have to start to identify themselves with the image created by the advertisement.
* The vision of America in Coke ads achieves its identity by identifying itself with the signifier 'Coke'
    * 'Coke' is the impersonal 'it', the 'real thing', the object-cause of desire.

Rigid designator aims at the impossible-real kernel, at what is 'in an object more than the object', at the surplus produced by the signifying operation. The radical contingency of naming implies an irreducible gap between the Real and modes of symbolization: a certain historical constellation can be symbolized in different ways: the Real contains no necessary mode of its symbolization.

The pure, meaningless signifier without the signified gives the unity of a given 'experience of meaning'.

#### The ideological anamorphosis

The essentialist illusion in defining 'democracy' etc. Is that it is possible to determine a definite cluster of features of positive properties which defines the permanent essence of 'democracy' and similar terms.

* Laclau's anti-essentialism: the only way to define 'democracy' is to say that it contains all political movements and organizations which legitimize, designate themselves as 'democratic'.
    * The only possible definition of an object in its identity is that this is the object which is always designated by the same signifier. It is the signifier which constitutes the kernel of the object's 'identity'.
* The fundamental paradox of the point de capiton: the 'rigid designator' is not a point of supreme density of Meaning. It is the element which represents the agency of the signifier within the field of the signified. In itself it is 'pure difference': its role is purely structural, its nature is purely performative- its signification coincides with its own act of enunciation. It is a 'signifier without the signified'.

The properly ideological dimension is the effect of an 'error of perspective': the element which represents the agency of pure signifier is perceived as a point of extreme saturation of Meaning. This error can be denoted as **ideological anamorphosis**.

### Identification (Lower Level of the Graph of Desire)
#### Retroactivity of meaning

Does the operation of quilting abolish the endless floating of signifiers without residue?

Graph of desire - succession of the four forms imply the retroactive changing of preceding forms.
![[Graph-1.png]]


First Form: 'elementary cell of desire' which presents the relation between signifier and the signified.

* Mythical, pre-symbolic intention (*Δ*) quilts the signifier's chain (vector S').
    * Signifier's chain is diachronic
    * Subject's chain is synchronic.
* Product of quilting is the divided subject ($) and at the same time the lack of signifier, empty space in the signifier's network.
* Shows process of interpellation of individuals (hypothetical) into subjects.
* Point de capiton is the point of the subjectivation of the signifier's chain.
* Retroactivity: the effect of meaning is always produced backwards, *apres coup*.
* Transference is the obverse of the staying behind of the signified with respect to the stream of the signifiers.
    * Illusion of original presence of meaning
    * Quilting effaces its own traces

#### The Effect of Retroversion

Instead of the linear, immanent, necessary progression where meaning unfolds itself from some initial kernel, we have a radically contingent process of retroactive production of meaning. The two points where intention cuts the signifying chain are: O - the big Other, and s(O) - the signified as the function of the big Other.

![[graph-2.png]]

Big Other as the synchronous symbolic code at the* point de capiton*. It submits preceding elements - signifiers- to the same code, regulates their mutual relations according to this code.
* Lacanian paradox: a synchronous, paradigmatic *structure* exists only in so far as it is itself again embodied in One, in an exceptional singular *element*.


Last part of the vector of the signifier S-S' is designated as 'Voice': meaningless object, objectal remnant, leftover of the signifying operation.
* Voice = signifier - retroactive 'quilting'.


Change at the bottom:
* $ is moved from left to right: subject as retroactive effect is experienced as something which was already there from the beginning.
* I(O) = symbolic identification; the identification of the subject with some signifying feature, trait (I), in the symbolic order (big Other).
    * Trait (I) represents the subject for another signifier, assumes concrete shape in a name or a mandate that the subject takes upon himself.
* Imaginary identification: axis connecting imaginary ego (e) and its imaginary other i(o).
    * To achieve self-identity, the subject must identify himself with the imaginary other and alienate himself.
    * The 'effect of retroversion' is based on the illusion of the self as the autonomous agent which is present from the very beginning. In this way, the subject misrecognizes his radical dependence on the big Other, on the symbolic order as his decentered cause.

#### Image and gaze

* Imaginary identification - ideal ego [*idealich*] - constituted identification: identification with the image in which we appear likeable to ourselves, image of 'what we would like to be'.
* Symbolic identification - ego-ideal [*Ich-Ideal*] - constitutive identification: identification with the place from where we are being observed, from where we look at ourselves so that we appear to ourselves likeable, worthy of love.


Trait (I) of identification is usually hidden. It can also be a certain failure, weakness, guilt of the other.
* E.g. Hitler: people identified with his hysterical outbursts of impotent rage, in his hysterical* acting out*.


Imaginary identification is always identification *on behalf of a certain gaze in the Other*. There is a gap between the way I see myself and the point from which I am being observed to appear likeable to myself.
* Hysterical tries to be an object of desire for the Other
* Gap is extreme with the obsessional neurotic.
    * On phenomenal level he is caught in the masochistic logic of his compulsive acts, humiliating himself, organizing his failure.
    * Where is the vicious, superego gaze for which he is humiliating himself?
        * Hegelian couple 'for-the-other'/ 'for-itself': the hysterical neurotic is experiencing himself as somebody who is enacting a role for the other, he is *himself* this other for whom he is enacting a role: his being-for-the-other is his being-for-himself.
* E.g. Chaplin's sadistic distance towards children implies the symbolic identification with the gaze of the children themselves.

#### From i(o) to I(O)

Ideal ego: i(o)

Ego-ideal: I(O)

Difference between the two exemplified in nicknames in American and Soviet culture.

* American: Charles 'Lucky' Luciano. Nickname replaces the first name, alludes to extraordinary event which has marked the individual, and a positive descriptive feature; something that sticks out on the individual, offers itself to our gaze, something seen and not the point from which we observe the individual.
* Soviet: Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili 'Stalin'. Nickname replaces family name. Russian "stalin" means made of iron and alludes to the laws of the historical process in the name of which Stalin, the empirical individual, is acting - the perspective from which he is observing himself and judging his activity. 'Stalin' is the ideal point from which the empirical individual is observing himself so that he appears likeable.

I(O) determines i(o): symbolic identification determines the image. The analysis of ideology must direct its attention to the points at which names which seem to signify positive descriptive features already function as 'rigid designators'.

Imaginary identification: imitation at the level of resemblance

Symbolic identification: identify at the point at which he is inimitable, eludes resemblance.
### Beyond Identification (Upper Level of the Graph of Desire)
#### 'Che vuoi?'

The interplay of imaginary and symbolic identification constitutes the mechanism by means of which the subject is integrated into a given socio-symbolic field.

Every quilting introduces a gap: '*che vuoi*': 'You are telling me that, but what do you want with it, what are you aiming at?'

* This gap is that between utterance and its enunciation.

![[graph-3.png]]

* Difference between desire and demand: you demand something of me, but what do you really want, what are you aiming at through this demand?
    * Hysterical demand: 'I'm demanding this of you, but what I'm really demanding of you is to refute my demand because this is not it!'

*North by Northwest*: Thornhill's situation corresponds to human being as a being-of-language (*parletre*)= subject is pinned to a signifier which represents him for the other, loaded with symbolic mandate, given a place in the intersubjective network of symbolic relations.

* The Other asks 'che vuoi?' but the subject does not know why he is occupying this place in the symbolic network. The only answer to the Other's question is the hysterical question: "Why am I what I'm supposed to be, why have I this mandate? *Why am I what you are saying that I am?*"
    * At the final moment of psychoanalysis, analysand gets rid of this question and accepts his being as* non-justified by the big Other*. 
    * Hysterical question is the articulation of the incapacity of the subject to fulfill the symbolic identification -hysteria as the effect and testimony of a failed interpellation.
    * Hysterical question: which is that surplus-object in me that caused the Other to interpellate me?
        * Opens the gap of the object in subject which resists interpellation.
            * E.g. The Last Temptation of Christ
                * The Other is lacking, Jesus Christ is hystericized

            * E.g. Rosetti's 'Ecce Ancilla Domini' painting

#### The Jew and Antigone

Fantasy is an answer to *'Che vuoi?*': in the case of anti-Semitism, the answer to 'What does the Jew want?' is a fantasy of 'Jewish conspiracy'.

* Fantasy is an imaginary scenario filling out the void, the opening of the *desire of the Other.*


Why was the Jew chosen as the object of racism par excellence: the Jewish God is the purest embodiment of *'Che vuoi?'*, of the desire of the Other in its terrifying abyss.

* The basic position of a Jewish believer is that of incomprehension, perplexity, horror at what the Other (God) wants.
* Jewish position is that of *God beyond -or prior to- the Holy*.

In contrast to the Jewish religion of *anxiety*, Christianity is a religion of *love*.

* Christians try to fill out the unbearable gap of the Other's desire by offering ourselves to the Other as the object of its desire.
* The subject fills in his own lack by offering himself to the other as the object filling out the lack in the Other -overlapping of two lacks annuls lack as such in a mutual completion.
* Christian saint vs pagan priest.
    * Priest is the 'functionary of the Holy'.
    * Saint occupies the place of *objet petit a*, persists in his inert presence.
* Antigone is a saint, not a priestess.
    * She does not give way on her desire, persists in the 'death drive.
    * She evokes in us the question 'What does she really want?', which precludes any identification with her.

#### Fantasy as a screen for the desire of the Other

Fantasy is
* Answer to the enigma of the desire of the Other, of the lack in the Other.
* Provides the co-ordinates of our desire, constructs the frame enabling us to desire something.
    * In the fantasy scene desire is constituted, not fulfilled or 'satisfied'.
* Desire itself is a defense against desire: the desire structured through fantasy is a defense against the desire of the Other, against 'pure', trans-phantasmic desire ('death drive' in its pure form).
* 'Normal' causality -linear chain of causes- is a defense against the cause with which we are concerned in psychoanalysis: this cause appears where 'normal' causality fails, breaks down.
    * E.g. why did the slip of tongue happen?

The role of fantasy is like that of transcendental schematism in the process of knowledge in Kant.
* Mediator, intermediary agency.
* An empirical, positively given object becomes an object of desire by entering the framework of fantasy, by being included in a fantasy-scene which gives consistency to the subject's desire.
    * Psychoanalytic doxa: man seeks in a woman features of his mother.
        * Lacan: mother is reduced to a limited set of symbolic features. When  the object is too close to the Mother-Thing, the desire is suffocated  in incestuous claustrophobia.
    * Fantasy enables us to seek maternal substitutes but it is also a screen shielding us from getting too close to the maternal Thing. 
        * E.g. *Vertigo *the hero follows a woman who adores a painting of Charlotte. Maternal friend paints exact copy of painting but places her own common face, and the effect is terrifying.

Hamlet is a drama of *failed interpellation*.
* First, interpellation of the ghost of the father-king. But father asks Hamlet not to harm his mother.
* Hamlet cannot act because of his doubts about the mother's desire.

#### The inconsistent Other of jouissance

Last component of the graph is the vector of enjoyment \[jouissance\] intersecting the vector of the symbolically structured desire:
![[graph-4.png]]

Two levels of the graph:
* Lower level of meaning- the problem is how the intersection of the signifying chain and of a mythical intention produces the effect of meaning, identification of the subject based on this retroactive production of meaning.
* Upper level of enjoyment - the problem is what happens when the field of the big Other is penetrated by a pre-symbolic (real) stream of enjoyment.
    * The body is submitted to castration, enjoyment is evacuated and the body survives dismembered.
    * On the left:
        * First, when enjoyment penetrates the field of the signifier, the only possible signifier of enjoyment is the signifier of the lack in the Other, the signifier of its inconsistency.
            * The big Other is also barré, structured around an impossible/traumatic kernel, around a central lack.
            * Separation: the object is separated from the Other itself, the Other is blocked, desiring.
                * The lack in the subject is the lack in the Other.
        * Then, formula of fantasy, the function of which is to conceal the lack in the Other.
        * Finally, s(O), the effect of signification as dominated by fantasy.
    * On the right:
        * The formula of drive: evacuation of enjoyment is never fully accomplished, there are always leftovers (designated with D, symbolic demand)
            * Formula of drive is also formula of *sinthome, *the impossible junction of enjoyment with the signifier.
    * Desire (d) is supported by fantasy. Fantasy conceals the fact that the Other is structured around some traumatic impossibility (around something that cannot be symbolized, the real of* jouissance*). Through fantasy, *jouissance* is domesticated, gentrified.
        * After we 'traverse' fantasy, what we are left with is death drive: no yearning, or any sublime phenomenon, only drive pulsating around the *sinthome*.
            * Going through the fantasy is correlative with identification with a* sinthome*.

#### 'Going through' the social fantasy

The upper level of the graph designates the dimension 'beyond interpellation': the impossible 'square of the circle' of symbolic and/or imaginary identification always has remainder which opens space for desire and makes the Other inconsistent, with fantasy as an attempt to conceal this inconsistency in the Other.

Post-structuralists (like Althusser) focus on the lower level of the graph of desire and try to grasp the efficiency of an ideology exclusively through mechanisms of imaginary and symbolic identification.

* The last support of the ideological effect is the non-sensical, pre-ideological kernel of enjoyment.


Two procedures of the 'criticism of ideology':

* Discursive; the symptomal reading of the ideological texts bringing about the deconstruction of the spontaneous experience of its meaning.
    * E.g: the network of symbolic overdetermination invested in the figure of the Jew.

        * Displacement: displacing social antagonism into antagonism between the social body and the Jew that is corrupting it.

        * Condensation: the figure of the Jew condenses opposing features associated with lower and upper classes: Jews are dirty *and* intellectual, voluptuous *and* impotent etc.

* Other procedure aims at the kernel of enjoyment, aiming at articulating the way in which an ideology implies, manipulates, produces a pre-ideological enjoyment structured in fantasy.
    * 'There is no class relationship', society as fantasy is traversed by an antagonistic split which cannot be integrated into symbolic order.
    * Social-ideological fantasy constructs a vision of society which does exist, a society not split by an antagonistic division, in which the relation between its parts is organic, complementary.
    * The distance between the non-split society and the factually split society is embodied in the Jew: a fetish which simultaneously denies and embodies the structural impossibility of 'Society'. 
    * *Fantasy is a means for an ideology to take its own failure into account in advance.*

Formula of the basic procedure of the 'criticism of ideology': to detect, in a given ideological edifice, the element which represents within it its own impossibility.

* What is excluded from the Symbolic returns in the Real as a paranoid construction of the 'Jew'.


In going through the fantasy, we must identify with the symptom; recognize in the properties attributed to 'Jew' the necessary product of our very social system; the truth about ourselves.

## 4 You Only Die Twice
### Between the two deaths

Lacan's periods in terms of articulation of the death drive and the signifier:
* *First period:* the word is a death of a thing: as soon as the reality is symbolized, the thing itself is more present in a word than its immediate physical reality.
* *Second period: *emphasis shifts to language as a synchronic structure, senseless autonomous mechanism which produces meaning as its effect.
    * Structuralist conception of language
    * Death drive is identified with the symbolic order itself - it is a mask of the symbolic order.
    * Imaginary experience of meaning vs. Meaningless signifier/signifying mechanism producing it.
        * Pleasure principle vs. Blind automatism 'beyond the pleasure principle' disturbing natural homeostatic balance.
* *Third period:* Emphasis on Real as impossible.
    * Symbolic order identified with the pleasure principle, beyond is a real kernel, traumatic core.
        * The Thing as an incarnation of the impossible *jouissance*.
    * Death drive is the possibility of the 'second death', radical annihilation of the symbolic texture through which so-called reality is constituted.
        * Symbolic death

This distinction has consequences for the determination of the final moment of psychoanalytic cure:
* *First period:*
    * Symptoms are non-symbolized imaginary elements of the history of the subject, 
    * process of analysis is that of their symbolization: analysis gives meaning, retroactively, to what was in the beginning a meaningless trace. 
    * The final moment of analysis is when the subject is able to narrate to the Other his own history in its continuity; when his desire is integrated, recognized in 'full speech'.
    * Subject may not be lacking
* *Second period:*
    * Symbolic order imposes on the subject a traumatic loss- symbolic castration
    * Final moment of analysis is when the subject consents to symbolic castration as a price to be paid for access to his desire.
    * Subject is lacking
* *Third period:*
    * Big Other with a traumatic element at its very heart
    * Final moment of analysis  is 'going through the fantasy'. There is nothing behind the fantasy, it is a construction to hide this 'nothing' - lack in the Other.
    * The Other is lacking

Knowledge in the Real, the Real forgets its knowledge.

Everybody must die twice - Hegel's theory of repetition in history.

Distinction between two deaths:
* Natural death which is part of the natural cycle of generation and corruption. 
* Absolute death as the eradication of the cycle itself which liberates nature from its own laws
* Symbolization, 'settling of debts', the accomplishment of symbolic destiny.

Sade's characters possess a body excepted from the vital cycle, **sublime body**.

The place between two deaths is the site of the real-traumatic kernel in the midst of symbolic order. This place is opened by symbolization/historicization which implies a non-historical kernel around which the symbolic network is articulated.
* Non-historical 'ex-timate' kernel touched by Walter Benjamin who conceived history as a series of events which 'will have been', their historical dimension is decided afterwards through inscription in the symbolic network.


### Revolution as repetition

Benjamin: historical materialism can triumph only if it enlists the services of theology.

* Enlists, but is caught up in it
* Contradiction like the signifier and the signified,
    * Signified, materialism
    * 'theology' designates the agency of the signifier. Signified is only effect of internal mechanism of signifier.

Benjamin: 'in* Eingedenken*, we make an experience which forbids us to conceive history in a fundamentally atheological way.'

* Retroactivity

* Isolation of a piece of the past from the continuity of history.
    * Freudian opposition between interpretation *en détail* and interpretation *en masse*.
* *Eingedenken* is an appropriation of the past which is 'interested', biased towards the oppressed class.
    * Looking through symptoms

* Ruling class vs oppressed class asymmetry:
    * empty, homogeneous time of continuity (official historiography)
        * A priori gaze of 'those who have won'.
        * Leaves out of consideration what failed in history.
        * Denies contingency
    * the 'filled' time of discontinuity (historical materialism)
        * Views history of great achievements with detachment.
        * There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.
        * Carries yearning for redemption: appropriates the past in so far as the past already contains the dimension of the future.

Historical materialist crystallizes configuration, has capacity to arrest, immobilize historical movement and to isolate the detail from its historical totality.

* Vs Marxist doxa according to which we must grasp events in the totality of their interconnection and in their dialectical movement.
* Crystallization into* a monad:* actual moment to which the past is directly attached.
    * The past is filled out with the present, the moment of the revolutionary chance decides a lot of all past failed revolutionary attempts.
    * 'Filled-out time' announces the *compulsion to repeat*. 
        * Arrest of historical movement corresponds to the 'short-circuit' between present and past speech in transferential situation
        * Repetition located outside time in the sense of the pure signifier's synchrony.
        * Monad as the point of suspended dialectics, of pure repetition where historical movement is placed within parentheses.
            * This is only possible in the field of the signifier, in its synchrony.

The actual revolutionary situation is not a kind of return of the repressed.

* The returns of the repressed, symptoms, are failed revolutionary attempts.
* Actual revolutionary situation presents attempt to unfold and redeem the symptom - realize in the Symbolic-.

### The 'perspective of the Last Judgement'

Perspective of events are not but always 'will have been' is to view the historical process from the perspective of a 'Last Judgement'- point of accomplished symbolization, of the 'end of history'.

* Stalinism implies a Platonic heaven in the form of the big Other determining the 'objective signification' of each event and action.


Benjamin vs Stalinism:

* Stalinist perspective is that of a victor whose final triumph is guaranteed in advance by the 'objective necessity of history'- history is evolutionary.
* Benjamin: the perspective of the Last Judgement is the perspective of those who have paid the price for a series of great historical triumphs.
    * Revolution is not part of continuous historical evolution but a moment of 'stasis' when the continuity is broken.
    * Past attempts will be redeemed and receive their signification.
    * Revolution is a creationist act, radical intrusion of the 'death drive': erasure of the reigning Text, creation *ex nihilo* of a new Text by means of which the stifled past 'will have been'.
* Antigone vs Creon.
* Creationist materialism vs evolutionary idealism.

Benjamin at first seems anti-Hegelian since Hegel's dialectic process is thought as evolutionist. But Hegel is anti-evolutionist: the absolute negativity which sets in motion dialectical movement is the intervention of the death drive as radically non-historical. Historical movement includes the non-historical dimension of 'absolute negativity'.

Stalinist communist is between two deaths. He has sublime body, outside of natural forces.

### From the Master to the Leader

Sublime body is like that of the King.

What is the difference between the classical Master and the totalitarian Leader?

* The transubstantiated body of the classical Master is an effect of the performative mechanism (of King's subjects).
    * The classical Master must legitimize his rule with a reference to some non-social, external authority.
* The totalitarian Leader no longer needs this external point of reference to legitimize his rule: "I am your Master because you treat me as your Master; it is you, with your activity, who make me your Master!"
    * The Leader's point of reference (the People, the Class, the Nation) *does not exist*, only exists through and in its fetishistic representative, the Party and its Leader.
    * Totalitarian misrecognition of the performative dimension: the Party thinks that it is the Party because it represents the People's real interests, expressing their will, but in reality the People are the People because they are embodied in the Party.
        * The People always support the Party because any member of the People who opposes Party rule automatically excludes himself from the People.

Lacan: democracy is a sociopolitical order in which the People do not exist. The place of Power is an empty place.

Elections:

* Lefort: elections as acts of symbolic dissolution of the social edifice, but we take part as abstract citizens, atomized individuals.
* Society as an organic unity ceases to exist, result depends on a purely quantitative mechanism of counting - a stochastic process.
* Democracy makes possible all sorts of corruption but we cannot elminate the possibility of such deformations: example of the Hegelian Universal which can realize itself only in impure, corrupted forms; if we want to remove these deformations, we obtain the very opposite.
    * 'Organized democracy' is a way of excluding the irruption of the Real which characterizes 'formal' democracy.
    * Although in reality there are only deformations, the universal notion of 'democracy' is necessary fiction; symbolic fact in the absence of which effective democracy could not produce itself.

Hegelian Universal is a 'fiction' as exists nowhere in reality but is none the less implied by 'reality' itself as a point of reference conferring on it its symbolic consistency.

# III The Subject
## 5 Which Subject of the Real?
### 'There is no metalanguage'

Lacan's "there is no metalanguage" is different from post-structuralism (Derrida) and hermeneutics (Gadamer)

* Post-structuralism:
    * The interpretation of a text resides on the same plane as its 'object'.
        * No 'pure' literary object not containing distance towards itself.
    * Text sets up distance from itself, no object-text and external interpretation opposition.
    * Claim to truth in parentheses, exposing the textual mechanisms producing the 'truth effect'.
    * Metonymy > metaphor. Metaphorical cut is doomed to fail.
* Lacan: metaphor > metonymy.
    * Metonymical sliding must always be supported by a metaphorical cut.
    * 'I always speak the truth'
* Post structuralist interpretation of *Point de capiton*: lack is *localized *in a point of exception which guarantees the consistency of all the other elements, by the mere fact that it is determined as 'symbolic castration', that the phallus is defined as its signifier.
    * This interpretation is too perfect, works too well.
    * The position of the deconstructivist where he can make sure that 'there is no metalanguage' (that no utterance can say precisely what it intended to say) is *the position of metalanguage*.
    * Hegelian 'bad infinity', endless quasi-poetical variation on the same theoretical assumption.
    * Post-structuralist position is too theoritical, excludes the truth-dimension, does not affect the place from which we speak.

### The phallic signifier

"This is precisely that I want to say and what I am saying."

* Post-structuralist reading: Lacan wants to retain the position of the Master, as if his own text is exempt from the gap between what is said and what he intends to say.
* Lacan: such 'impossible' utterances which follow the logic of the paradox 'I am lying', keep the fundamental gap of the signifying process open and prevent us from assuming a metalanguage position.

Metalanguage is the Real, impossible to occupy its position or to avoid it.

* The only way to avoid it is to produce an utterance of pure metalanguage which materializes its own impossibility, *embodies absolute otherness*.
* Phallus as signifier, index of its own impossibility.
    * Signifier of 'castration' of its own lack.
        * Substitute for objet a

    * Gives body to a fundamental loss, loss as such in positive existence.

Otto Fenichel: logic of insulting involves imitating one of his features.

* German gesture of extending hand on nose is the first part of the sentence: "yours is so big and powerful but in spite of that, you are impotent. You cannot hurt me with it."
    * The adversary in forced choice, castration.
    * Demonstration of power starts to function as confirmation of a fundamental impotence.

### 'Lenin in Warsaw' as object

Post-structuralism: ordinary language is the ultimate metalanguage. It is self-referential, place of auto-reflexive movement.
* One gets rid of the object by pointing out how 'reality' is already structured through the medium of language.
* metonymy

Lacan: all language is an object-language, *there is no language without object*.
* There is objective, non-signifying 'reference' to the self-referential movement.
* Self-referential movement is elliptical movement around a void.
* *Objet petit a *(original lost object) is the embodiment of this void.
* metaphor

Derrida: the letter always possesses its title-address.
* Closed economy of the concept of Symbolic, the central point of reference precludes the possibility that a letter could go astray.


Lacanian title of a picture: Lenin in Warsaw.
* The title names the object which is lacking in the field of what is depicted.
* The visitor is in metaphysical trap- establishing a distance between the picture and the title as sign-denoted object.
* The title is on the same surface as what is depicted. Its distance is internal, something must fall out from the picture (the object which is replaced by the title).
* Freud:* vorstellungsreprasentanz*: the representative, the signifying element filling the vacant place of the missing representation.
    * The exclusion of the 'originally repressed' presentation is the positive condition for the emergence of what is being depicted.
* When the vorstellungsreprasentanz is not connected to the lack in the Other, it begins to function as a 'title'; metalanguage designation.
* *Master signifier*
* Signifier which is a part of the representation of reality

Joke about the **logic of the object**: soldier looking at papers, then says 'that is it!'.
* An object produced by the signifying texture itself.
* The process of searching produces the object which causes it: desire produces its own object-cause.
* Object must be included in the signifying texture.

### Antagonism as Real

The Real is usually conceived as a hard kernel resisting symbolization, persisting in its place and always returning to it.

Fredric Brown's Experiment: what would happen if the Professor decides not to put the cube in the machine for the past?
* Cube remains but the entire Universe vanishes.


(1950s) Lacan: the ethical imperative is the mode of the presence of the Real in the Symbolic: even if all symbolic reality dissolves itself, the Real -the small cube- will return to its place.
* Real is pre-symbolic reality
* Symbolic order structures our perception of reality
* Imaginary, level of illusory entities who are mere structural effect with no real existence.

1960s: the Real approaches the Imaginary. Real as lack of symbolization, does not exist before it.

Trauma:
* 1950s: the traumatic event is an imaginary entity not fully symbolized.
* 1970s: trauma is real - a hard core resisting symbolization. It produces structural effects (displacements, repetitions etc.)
    * The Real must be constructed afterwards so that we can account for the distortions of the symbolic structure.
    * E.g. Freud's primal parricide.
    * E.g. Hegel: the primal fight to death between the (future) master and servant. It must be presupposed.

Lacanian*** subjet supposé savoir*: a real entity**: it does not exist but it produces a decisive shift in the development of the psychoanalytic cure.

MacGuffin: the only significance is that it has some significance for the character.
* A pure nothing which is none the less efficient.
* Objet petit a, pure void which functions as the object-cause of desire.


Laclau & Mouffe: antagonism is Real: it is a certain limit in which is in itself nothing, it is to be constructed retroactive from a series of its effects as the traumatic point which escapes them. It prevents a closure of the social field.
* E.g. class struggle: it is not the last signifier giving meaning to all social phenomena. It is pure negativity.
    * Present in its effects, attempt to totalize the social field is doomed to failure.
    * Immanent negativity of society

The Real par excellence is jouissance. Paradox of the presence of the Real: the prohibition of something which is already in itself impossible.

E.g. child sexuality

E.g. Wittgenstein: 'whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.'

E.g. Kant: you can, because you must!

* The impossibility relates to the level of existence while prohibition relates to the properties it predicates.


### The forced choice of freedom

Freedom is Real.

* Post-structuralists: 'freedom' is imaginary experience resting on blindness to the structural causality determining activity of subjects.

* Lacan: freedom is real-impossible.


Forced choice: Community to subject: you have freedom to choose, on the condition that you choose the right thing. Choosing the wrong choice leads to loss of freedom of choice itself.

* Subject must freely choose the community to which he already belongs, he must choose what is already given to him.
    * Forced choice of social contract
* He never chooses, he is always treated as if he had already chosen.
* He cannot choose, the subject who thinks he has free choice is a _psychotic_ subject, retaining a distance from the symbolic other.
    * Totalitarian subject closer to psychotic position: the status of Jew as subject supposed to have made a free choice and freely chosen the wrong side.

Kant's conception of choice of Evil as an a priori, transcendental act; wickedness is given, the person cannot outgrow it via his ultimate moral development.

* The evil person is also responsible for his wickedness.
* Act of choosing never too place but nonetheless constitutes the very frame of the subject's development.
    * Kant, evil as such acquired a proper ethical status, beyond the pleasure and reality principles.
* Schelling: distinction between freedom and consciousness: the atemporal choice is unconscious choice.
    * Vs. Fichte, who reduced free activity to the self-reflection of consciousness.
    * Irrational guilt, felt without accomplishing the act, excessive guilt which masks the psychic reality of an unconscious desire bears witness to an unconscious decision for Evil.
    * Corresponds to Lacanian Real as act which never took place in reality but must be presupposed, constructed afterwards to account for the present state of things.

### Coincidentia oppositorum

Real is both the hard kernel resisting symbolization (jouissance, transcendent) and pure chimerical entity (voice/surplus-enjoyment, immanent) which has in itself \{==no ontological consistency==\}\{\>\>Ontik vs ontolojik: ontoloji, subject ile mediation’a girmiş (represented), ontik; immediate, non-mediated (thing-in-itself)\<\<\}. Hard core, but persists only as failed, missed, and dissolves as soon as we try to grasp it in its positive nature.
* Traumatic event constructed retroactively, is fantasy-construct filling out a certain void in a symbolic structure and is a retroactive effect of this structure.


Series of oppositions which define the Real:
* Real as starting point, preceding the symbolic order and is subsequently structured by it when it gets caught in its network. Also the Real is the leftover, product, scraps of symbolization.
    * Hegelian: Real is presupposed and posited by the symbolic
    * Jouissance vs surplus-enjoyment: jouissance is basis emptied by symbolization, process produces leftover, which is the surplus-enjoyment.
* Real is the fullness of the inert presence, positivity. There is no lack in Real. At the same time, Real is the gap, lack around which the symbolic order is structured.
* Cannot be negated because it is already in itself, in its positivity, nothing but an embodiment of a pure negativity, emptiness.
    * Sublime object: object which is just an embodiment of the lack in the Other, in the symbolic order. 
        * We cannot get too close to it, it loses sublime features and becomes vulgar object.
        * Can only exist half-seen
* Jacques-Alain Miller: Real is at the same time corporeal contingency and that of logical consistency.
    * At first, shock of a contingent encounter which disrupts the automatic circulation of the symbolic mechanism.
    * Traumatic event is nowhere given in its positivity, only logically constructed as a point which escapes symbolization.
* Quid vs quod: 
    * Quid: properties of a symbolic-universal nature attributed to an object
    * Quod: this object itself in its givenness, a surplus of an X escaping the network of universal-symbolic determinations.
    * Real is the surplus of quod over quid; pure positivity beyond the series of properties but at the same time, an entity which does not exist but has nevertheless a series of properties.
* Écrit: the Real cannot be inscribed, at the same time, the Real is the writing itself as opposed to the signifier.

Status of the couples of oppositions:
* *Imaginary*- two poles of opposition are_ complementary_, harmonious totality, filling the lack of each other.
    * E.g. fantasy of fully realized sexual relationship
* *Symbolic*- _differential_, identity of each moment consists in its difference to the opposite moment. Each element takes the place of the lack in the other, its positive presence is nothing but an objectification of a lack in its opposite element.
    * Symbolic communication: certain void that circulates between subjects, subjects pass to each other a common lack.
        * Woman is the incarnation of man's castration
* *Real*- each pole passes immediately into its opposite, each is already in itself its own opposite. Point of_ immediate coincidence_.
    * Hegel: Being and Nothingness are not complementary. Being in itself when we try to grasp it in pure abstraction and indeterminacy, reveals itself to be Nothingness.

Hegel's criticism of Kantian thing-in-itself:
* Thing-in-itself is surplus of objectivity, pure 'thing-of-thought', pure form of Thought. What remains empty after abstraction of all particular, determinate contents is a pure, _empty form of Thought_.
* Sublation?

Lacan: the Real can be inscribed only through a deadlock of formalization. The Real doesn't cease not to inscribe itself. The Real is *nothing but* this impossibility of its inscription.
* Subject is failure point of the process of his symbolic representation.
    * That part of Real which suffers from signification.
    * Subject is Real, virtual point, nothing but a failure.

Lacan: object as real is just a limit: we can overtake it, but we cannot reach it.
* Lacanian reading of the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise.
* Free association: we cannot really spontaneously give ourselves to it, but we cannot escape it, whatever we say in analysis already has the status of free association.

### Another Hegelian joke

Corresponding to the paradoxical character of the Real, Lacanian subject is _alienated_ in the signifier: as soon as it is caught up, it is mortified, dismembered, divided.
* Reflexivity of desire: desire is always a desire of a desire- "I have so many desires, which of them is worth being the object of my desire? Which desire should I desire?"
* Same paradox in Stalinist political process: the victim is at the same time supposed to confess his bourgeoisie, and express an attitude of disgust towards his own activity.
    * Subject of statement vs subject of enunciation: subject of enunciation is supposed to confess and determine the subject of statement as a traitor
        * Laclau: language is a Stalinist phenomenon.

Post-structuralism: subject reduced to subjectivation, an effect of fundamentally non-subjective process, always caught in it (subject of statement, subject of the signified).
* Lacan: subject is the empty place filled out with the symbolic richness (subject of enunciation, subject of the signifier).
    * _Subjectivation masks a lack in the structure, a lack which is the subject._

Soviet joke about Rabinovitch:
* First reason to emigrate is possible failure of Soviet Union, second reason after bureaucrat responds, is that the Soviet Union may last fo rever.
    * Hegelian '*spirit is a bone*': failure of the first reading gives us the true meaning.
        * The most immaterial thing about person is determined by material contingent thing.
        * Aufhebung, sublation, must have material leftover.
    * Hegelian triad:
        * First reason is 'thesis'
        * Bureaucrat's objection is 'anti-thesis'
        * 'Synthesis' is exactly the same as the anti-thesis; the only difference is in a change of perspective.
            * Logic of the 'negation of the negation': the negativity preserves its disruptive power, we come to experience how it is also a positive condition of our identity.
                * E.g. without a reference to the Jew, the social fabric itself would be dissolved.
                * My positive consistency is a 'reaction-formation' to a traumatic, antagonistic kernel.
                * In negation, there is still the positive identity being negated, but in negation of negation, negativity is prior to what is being negated.

Antagonism is hole in the field of the symbolic Other, void of an unanswered question. Negation of the negation is like a paradoxical twist where *the question itself begins to function as its own answer*.
* Adorno: there is no one appropriate definition of Society, we are caught in the opposition between 'organicism' and 'individualism'.
    * This opposition is not obstacle to the definition of Society, it is* its very definition*.
    * _Epistemological impotence → ontological impossibility_: Thing-in-itself is already split, marked by a radical lack, structured around an antagonistic kernel.
* The impenetrability of the substantial Other is immediately an index of the fact that this Other is already in itself hindered, structured around a certain 'indigestible' rock, resisting symbolization.
    * The Other is *already subject* because of this impossibility to achieve full identity with itself.
    * Society as Substance is already subject.

### Subject as an 'answer of the Real'

What is the status of the subject before subjectivation?

* Lacan: subject is an answer of the Real to the question _asked by the big Othe_r. It is the void of impossibility of answering {==the question of the Other==}{>>Lack in the Other
* “Am I alive or dead?”
* “Am I a man or a woman?”<<}.
    * Bodenheimer: the form of the question as such is {==obscene==}{>>Because there is no answer in the symbolic order to the question.
    * Obscene= not included in the law<<}, it invades the sphere of intimacy.
        * Questioning child, guilt is admitted on the level of desire, any answer to question is an excuse.
    * Questioning is the basic procedure of the totalitarian intersubjective relationship. Totalitarian power is not a dogmatism which has all the answers; it is the instance which has all the {==questions==}{>>Must be left unanswered for the appearance of Other to hold up. (appearance qua appearance)<<}.
    * Indecency of the question is in its drive to put into words what should be left unspoken.
        * Question aims at the lack of the other, both in questioning authority and questioning child.
        * Question makes the subject formally responsible for the given state of things in a negative way, responsible for his impotence.

What is the point in the other at which the word fails, this point of impotence at which the question as such is aiming?

* Freud:* Kern unseres Wesens*
* Lacan:* das Ding*: innermost, intimate kernel, strange body in my interior which is 'in me more than me', radically interior and at the same time already exterior, _*extimate*_.
    * Plato: agalma, essential object which cannot be objectivated.
    * Objet petit a, hard core embodying horrifying jouissance, enjoyment, and as such an object which simultaneously attracts and repels us- divides our desire and thus provokes shame.
    * Subject is originally divided as to the object himself, as to the Thing, which at the same time attracts and repels him: $ *◊* a

The question hystericizes the addressee, constituting the subject. Subject as such is hysterical.

The process of interpellation-subjectivation is an attempt to elude this traumatic kernel through identification.

* Reverse is possible in perverse position, subject identifies with the object and relieves himself of the burden of the question.
* Psychoanalysis also de-hystericizes, impotence of the subject displaced as impossibility proper to the Other.

Subject is an impossible answer, consubstantive with guilt

* Incrimination puts the subject in the position of somebody who is already presumed to know.


### S(A), a, **ϕ** 

Three types of object a:
* MacGuffin, 'nothing at all', empty place, pure pretext for setting the action in motion.
    * Objet petit a
    * Pure semblance: it is totally indifferent and absent; its signification is purely auto-reflexive, consists in the fact tha tit has some signification for others.
* Material presence of a fragment of reality, leftovers that cannot be reduced to a network of formal relations proper to the symbolic structure, but at the same time, the positive condition for the effectuation of the formal structure.
    * Signifier of the lack in the Other
    * E.g. *Lenin in Warsaw*
    * Object of exchange circulating among subjects, serving as a kind of guarantee on their symbolic relationship.
    * Unique, non-specular; it has no double.
    * Symbolic pact can establish itself in so far as it is embodied in a totally contingent material element which disrupts the homeostatic indifference of relations between subjects.
    * Imaginary balance → structured network through a shock of the Real.
    * Lacan is not a structuralist: formal structure is itself tied by an umbilical cord to some radically contingent material element because the big Other is always barred.
    * Laclau and Mouffe: distinction between _accidental_ (an ordinary element of a structure that can be interchanged) and _contingent_ (embodies the formal structure, not necessary but a positive condition of the restoration of the structural necessity)
* Object that is the mute embodiment of an impossible jouissance. Imaginary objectification of the Real.
    * Φ
    * E.g. birds in *The Birds*

Symbolization of the Imaginary:

### The subject presumed to...

Mystery of transference: to *produce* new meaning, it is necessary to *presuppose* its existence in the other.
* Analyst as subject presumed to know the meaning of the analysand's symptoms.


Three concepts around the subject presumed to know:
* *Subject presumed to believe*.
    * Toilet paper supply is going to diminish, I must buy more.
    * 'I know very well that there is more than enough, but there are probably some naive people who believe these rumors'
        * Naive believers do not have to exist effectively: to produce the effect in reality, it is enough that he is presumed by others to exist.
    * Clinical use: "I don't believe in maternal phallus etc. But happily here is an analyst who believes in it and perhaps he can cure me with his belief!"
    * Desire is disavowed, perverse position.
* *Subject presumed to enjoy.*
    * Fundamental in obsessional neurosis: the traumatic point is the supposed existence, in the other, of an insupportable, limitless, horrifying *jouissance*.
        * The stake is to save the Other from his jouissance
    * Supposed *jouissance* in racism: the Other is always presumed to have access to some specific enjoyment.
* *Subject presumed to desire.*
    * Plays important role in hysterical neurosis
    * Subject presumed to know how to organize her desire, how to avoid its deadlock.
    * The hysterical subject needs to have recourse to another subject to organize his desire.
        * The hysterical desire is the desire of the other.

### The presumed knowledge

Analysis of ideological mechanisms:
* Oriental despotism - the figure of the despot presumed to enjoy
* Stalinism - leadership is presumed to know


Subject supposed to know is the basis, the other three disguise the paradox of it.

Hitchcock's *Foreign Correspondent*
* Father lets the extortioner know that he has seen through his cards in the form of the confession.
    * Unconsciously, he desires unmasking and self-destruction, the truth articulates itself in the form of the confession.
        * Unconscious itself as a desire which articulates itself in the gap separationg the form from its content, in the autonomy of the form.

Mozart:
* Form articulates the 'repressed' truth of the content.
    * E.g. *Don Giovanni*
    * E.g. *Le nozze di Figaro*
        * The count articulates his anger in the very melody used by Figaro and Susanna to express their reconciliation
        * He does not know yet that he already knows
* From Romantic perspective, Mozart's procedure is 'mechanical', psychologically unconvincing, an automatic repetition of the same melodic line irrespective of the changed psychological constellation.
    * Automatism to repeat
    * The status of the unconscious 'compulsion to repeat' is not psychological, the discord between form and content articulates the unconscious truth as yet inaccessible to his psychological experience.
* In Romantics, the form is without its own content, truth is measured exclusively by the expression of the psychological subjectivity in the form.

### 'The fear of error is... the error itself'

Hegel is Mozartian:
* Hegel's notion of the 'formal side' articulating the truth of a given phenomenon.
    * Truth and appearance relation: Truth is not a surplus eluding us, it appears in the form of traumatic encounters, we encounter it where we presumed the presence of 'mere appearance': the 'shock of the truth' consists in this sudden emergence in the midst of the realm of reassuring phenomena.
    * Kant's 'unthinkable': appearance itself, without knowing it, touches the truth.
        * Obsessional economy = avoiding the traumatic encounter of the Truth.
            * Limiting our experience outside the 'Thing-in-itself' is apparently an aspiration to truth.
            * Hegel: fear of confusing the phenomena and the Thing-in-itself, conceals the fear of Truth - it announces a desire to elude, at any price, an encounter with the Truth.
    * Hegel: most radical illusion is a refusal to recognize the presence of the Truth - in pretending that we are still dealing with a fictitious appearance, when Truth is already here.

*Three Days of the Condor* exemplifies this paradoxical, self-reflexive character of the illusion.
* CIA agent proposes a fiction without knowing that he had touched the truth.
    * Lacan: truth has the structure of a fiction.
    * 'Truth' is an empty place, the effect of Truth is produced when some piece of 'fiction' (symbolically structured knowledge) finds itself occupying this place, as in Pollack's movie.

Fear of error - obsessional neurotic.
* Procrastination, endless precautions.


Kant → Hegel, hystericization of the obsessional's position.
* Dialectical relation between hysterical and obsessional neurosis: hysteria as a fundamental determination of a neurotic position contains two species; obsessional neurosis and itself as its own species.


Hysteria and obsession as symmetrical opposition:
* Hysterical symptom articulates repressed *desire*, obsessional symptom stages the *punishment* for realizing this desire.
* Hysterical neurotic *hastens through*, overtakes himself, misses the object of desire. Obsessional neurotic postpones the encounter of the object *ad infinitum*.
* For hysterical neurotic, the object procures *too little* enjoyment (this is not it). Obsessional neurotic, the object offers him *too much* enjoyment.
* Hysterical feels that he 'doesn't know what he wants', addresses the question concerning his desire *to the other* (subject presumed to know). Obsessional neurotic is tortured by doubt; he cannot decide, he addresses his question *to himself*.

Actually not symmetrical: hysterical is always 'unmarked', functions as a neutral universal medium of the opposition. Obsessional is 'marked and introduces a specific difference.
* Obsessional question addressed to himself is a masked form of the demand addressed to the other. The postponement of the encounter because of unbearable excessive enjoyment is a refined way of avoiding disappointment with the object, postponement conceals a foreboding that the object itself 'is not it'.
    * Kant's postponement of the encounter with the Thing, conceals a foreboding that perhaps this Thing is itself nothing but a lack, an empty place. That beyond the phenomenal appearance there is only a certain negative self-relationship because of which the positively given phenomenal world is perceived as 'mere appearance'.

### 'The supersensible is therefore appearance qua appearance'

The supersensible is the sensuous and the perceived posited as it is in truth; but the truth of the sensous and the perceived is to be appearance. The supersensible is therefore *appearance qua appearance*.

* The appearance implies that there is something behind it which appears through it.
* Simultaneously hides and reveals the essence behind its curtain. What is hidden behind the phenomenal appearance? The fact that there is nothing to hide. What is concealed is that the very act of concealing conceals nothing.

Is the supersensible a pure illusion of the consciousness, a *trompe l'oeil*?

* If behind the curtain there is nothing, the subject constitutes himself through the mediation of this 'nothing', in the very act of his misrecognition.
* The illusion that there is something hidden is a reflexive one: what is hidden is the possibility of this very illusion- behind the curtain is the fact that the subject thinks something must be behind it.
* Illusion opens a place where it is possible, an empty space that it fills out - where the illusory reality, reduplicating the external, factual reality, could find its proper place.
    * In order that there may yet be something in the void, this complete void must be filled up with appearances by consciousness itself.
    * The supersensible Holy is first an empty place, then this emptiness is filled out with some content. Contents of the supersensible and of the sensuous world are the same; an object becomes 'holy' simply by changing places, by occupying, filling out, the empty place of the Holy.

Lacan: the place logically precedes objects which occupy it: the objects are not masking some other, but simply the emptiness they are filling out.

* Sublime object is an object elevated to the level of* das Ding*, it is its structural place that confers on it its sublimity.


Bunuel films, central motif of the 'non-explainable impossibility of the fulfillment of a simple desire'.

* Ordinary act becomes impossible to accomplish as soon as it finds itself occupying the impossible place of* das Ding* and begins to embody the sublime object of desire.


The void that the object is hiding -** lack in the Other.**

If we subtract from the illusion the illusion itself, what remains is not simply nothing but a **determinate nothing**, the void in the structure which opened the space for the 'illusion'.

* Beyond the phenomena, there is nothing but the nothing itself, 'nothing' which is the subject.
* What the subject finds beyond the appearance is his own act of passage.

Hegel's reduction to the elevation of the subject to the status of the substantial Essence of the totality of being:

* First, the consciousness thinks there is hidden transcendent Essence
* Then, passage from consciousness to self-consciousness, it experiences how this Essence is the subject himself.
    * Implies a radical failure, behind the curtain is* the nothing which 'is' the subject.*
    * Lacan: the subject of the signifier and the fantasy object are identical: the subject is the void, the hole in the Other, and the object the inert content filling up this void: subject's entire 'being' is the fantasy-object filling out his void.

Proper human deception is to imitate the dissimulation of reality, the act of concealing deceives us by pretending to conceal something.

* Substance is the positive, transcendent Essence supposed to be hidden,
* Substance as subject means to grasp that the curtain of phenomena conceals above all the fact that there is nothing to conceal. This nothing behind the curtain is the subject.

Jew joke: "Why are you telling me that you are going to Cracow and not to Lemberg, when you're really going to Cracow?"

* Telling the truth represents a breach of the implicit code of deception which rules the relationship.


Plato and painting: the painting is appearance which purports to be an appearance and for this reason is nothing but the Idea itself.

* Hegel: the supersensible Idea is the appearance qua appearance.
* 'Appearance as such is essential' only grasped with the hypothesis of the big Other which makes possible the deception in its properly human dimension.

Stalinism: maintain the appearance, everyone keeps a cynical distance from ruling ideology. **(external reflection)**

* Appearance is essential: if it were to be destroyed, the whole system would fall apart.
* Vs. Yugoslavia self-management: *(determinate reflection*)
    * Party-and-State bureaucracy reigns and designates itself as the principal enemy.
    * People drive Mercedes by proxy, through their representatives.
        * In the figure of 'alienated' substantial power, the subject must recognize *himself in his otherness*.
## 6 'Not Only as Substance, but Also as Subject'
### The logic of sublimity

Yovel's criticism to Hegel's systemization of religions:

* Christianity is preceded by three forms of 'religion of spiritual individuality'
* Hegel: Jewish religion of Sublimity is lower than Greek religion of Beauty
    * Yovel: dialectical process says that Jewish religion should follow the Greek.
* Triad of reflection:
    * Greek -* positing reflection*: (immediate) the plurality of spiritual individuals is posited as the given spiritual essence of the world.
    * Jewish - *external reflection*: (mediation) all positivity abolished by reference to the unapproachable, transcendent God, absolute Master, One of absolute negativity.
    * Christianity - *reflective determination*: individuality of man is not external to God, man as a 'reflective determination' of God himself. 
* Sublimity should follow Beauty because it is the point of its breakdown, of its mediation, of its self-referential negativity.
    * Kant: Beauty vs Sublimity - quality vs quantity, bounded vs boundless.
        * Beauty is sentiment of immediate harmony between Idea and the sensuous material of its expression
        * Sublimity is sentiment attached to chaotic, terrifying limitless phenomena.
        * Pleasure vs displeasure:
            * Beauty offers pleasure, sublime object gives pleasure through the mediation of displeasure.
            * Sublime is 'beyond the pleasure principle', paradoxical pleasure procured by displeasure itself.
                * jouissance
    * Immediacy vs mediation: the Sublime must follow Beauty as a form of mediation of its immediacy.

Kant: The Sublime object is an object whose representation determines the mind to regard the elevation of nature beyond our reach as equivalent to a presentation of ideas.

* Lacan: an object raised to the level of the impossible-real Thing.
* Paradox of the sublime object: we experience the impossibility of phenomenal objects presenting the Thing. By means of this permanent failure of representation, we have a presentiment of the true dimension of the Thing.
    * Gives us displeasure of its inadequacy to the Thing-Idea, through this inadequacy it gives us pleasure by indicating the true greatness of the Thing.
* Sublime is the paradox of an object which, in the field of representation, provides negatively a view of the dimension of what is unrepresentable.
    * The phenomenon's inability to represent the Thing adequately is inscribed in the phenomenon itself.
    * *Enthusiasm* precludes all positive presentation, example of purely negative presentation.

Hegel's criticism to Kant's Sublime:

* From Kant's point of view, Hegelian dialectics is *fanaticism*, it pretends to mediate the Idea with phenomena, fails to take into account the abyss separating phenomena from the Idea.
    * Hegel: none of the determinations mediate the Idea, the Idea is the very movement of sublation - liquidizing of all particular determinations.
    * Hegel: Kant remains a prisoner of the filed of representation. As soon as we determine the Thing as a transcendent surplus beyond what can be represented, starting from the field of representation, we determine the Thing as its negative limit.
* Hegel's position is not grasping the Thing 'in itself', from itself, as it is in its pure Beyond, without a negative reference to the field of representation.
* Kant presupposes the Thing-in-itself existing as something positively given beyond the field of representation.
    * *External reflection*
* Hegel: the experience of the radical fissure between the phenomenon and the Idea is the Idea itself as 'pure' radical negativity.
    * Thing-in-itself is radical negativity.
    * We must subtract the presupposition of the positive Thing, limit ourselves to what is strictly immanent to this experience, to pure negativity.
* Not only is the appearance never adequate to its essence, this essence itself is nothing but the inadequacy of the appearance to itself, to its notion.
* The sublime object does not indicate the dimension of a transcendent Thing-in-itself, it is an object which fills out the empty place of the Thing as the void.
    * The Sublime is an object whose positive body is just an embodiment of Nothing.
* *Infinite judgement*: the logic of an object which, by its inadequacy, 'gives body' to the absolute negativity of the Idea
    * Subject and predicate are radically incompatible
    * E.g. 'the Spirit is a *bone'*, '*Wealth* is the Self', 'the State is* Monarch*', 'God is *Christ*'

Kant - the Sublime evoked by boundless, terrifying phenomenon

Hegel - miserable 'little piece of the Real', the Spirit is the inert, dead skull.

* Negativity must embody itself in some miserable, radically contingent corporeal leftover.


### 'The Spirit is a bone'

At the level of representation, this proposition appears as vulgar materialism; reducing the spirit, the subject, to a rigid, fixed, dead object.

* Similar to Rabinovitch's first reason for leaving.
[Rabinovitch's first reason for leaving][Another Hegelian joke]

The negativity, unbearable discord, coincides with subjectivity itself.

Hegel: **'speculative proposition**', the true meaning arises from the failure of the first, immediate reading.

* Hegelian version of the Lacanian formula of fantasy: $ *◊* a


Hegel: physiognomy → phrenology

* Physiognomy: language of the body, belongs to the level of signifying representation.
    * Result is failure: every representation 'betrays' the subject, deforms what it is supposed to reveal. There is no proper signifier of the subject.
* Representation → presence
    * Skull is not a sign, represents nothing, it is the immediate presence of the Spirit.
    * Skull fills out the void, the impossibility of the signifying representation of the subject, by means of its presence.
        * Lacan: objectification of a certain lack: Thing occupies the place where the signifier is lacking. Fantasy-object fills out the lack in the Other.
    * The subject is the leftover, the leftover which resists 'subjectivation' embodies the impossibility which 'is' the subject. The subject is correlative to its own impossibility.

Hegel's 'idealist wager' consists in the conversion of the lack of the signifier into the signifier of the lack

* Lacan: the signifier of the lack is the phallus.


### 'Wealth is the Self'

Physiognomy → phrenology, later, language of flattery → Wealth:

* Triad:
    * Noble-minded consciousness:
        * Extreme alienation, all contents in common Good embodied in the State.
        * Serves the State with total devotion, attested by its acts.
        * Does not speak.
        * Good functions as entirely substantial entity.
    * The language of flattery:
        * Subjectivation of the State: Instead of the substantial State, Monarch who is able to say 'l'Etat, c'est moi.'
        * Heroism of silent service → heroism of flattery
        * Medium of activity is now language, flattery addressed to the Monarch who embodies the State.
        * How can flattery, seen as a renunciation of the ethical stance in pursuit of 'pathological' interests of gain and pleasure, obtain a properly ethical status?
            * Hegel: language, journey in which every figure of consciousness is defined by a modality of language.
                * E.g. initial 'sense-certainty' → discord between what the consciousness 'means to say' and what it effectively says activates the dialectical movement.
            * 'Language of flattery': in its form, it is what is at stake: it has for its content the form itself, the form which language itself is, and is authoritative as language.
            * Not pathological, announces the dimension of an alienation proper to language as such, the form of language introduces a radical alienation.
                * As soon as we start talking, truth is on the side of the Universal, of what we are 'effectively saying', inner sincerity becomes pathological, non-ethical.
                * The truth of what we are saying depends on the way our speech constitutes a social bond, on its performative function, not on the psychological 'sincerity' of our intention.
            * Ethical act in flattering the Monarch against one's convictions: by pronouncing empty phrases which disavow our innermost convictions, we submit ourselves to a compulsive disrupting of our narcissistic homeostasis, 'externalize' ourselves completely.
                * Flattery achieves a radical voidance of our 'personality', what remains is the empty form of the subject - *the subject as this empty form*.
        * Revolutionary Leninist consciousness → post-revolutionary Stalinist consciousness:
            * Faithful service to the revolutionary Cause turns into a 'heroism of flattery' addressed to the Leader.
            * In the name of our fidelity to the Cause, we are ready to sacrifice elementary sincerity, we are prepared to confess this insincerity and to declare ourselves traitors.
    * Wealth:
        * The subject, totally lost in the medium of language (language of gestures and grimaces; language of flattery), finds his objective counterpart in the inertia of a non-language object (skull, money).
        * Difference between 'bone' and 'Wealth' is that of the starting point:
            * If language is reduced to 'gestures and grimaces of the body', the objective counterpart to the subject is the skullbone, inert.
            * If language is the medium of the social relations of domination, its objective counterpart is wealth as the embodiment, as the materialization of social power.

### Positing, external, determinate reflection

The paradox of the infinite judgement escapes Kant because he is not able to accomplish the passage from 'external' to 'determinate' reflection.

* Kant: dialectical movement brings forth the feeling of Sublime, concerns only our subjective reflection external to the Thing.
* Hegel: dialectical movement is an immanent reflexive determination of the Thing-in-itself, *the Thing is nothing but this reflexive movement*.
* E.g. reading:
    * External reflection transposes the 'essence' of a text into the unattainable beyond, making of it a transcendent 'Thing-in-itself'.
    * Determinate reflection: we become aware of how this very externality of the external reflexive determinations (partial reflections of the true meaning of the text) of the 'essence' is already internal to this 'essence' itself.
    * E.g. *Antigone*
        * *Positing reflection*: "Antigone is in fact a drama about..."
        * *External reflection*: "we don't know what Sophocles really meant, the immediate truth of Antigone is unattainable..."
        * *Determinate Reflection*: Gadamer: there is more truth in the later efficacy of the text, in the series of its subsequent readings, than in its supposedly 'original' meaning. 
* The Thing-in-itself is found in its Truth through the loss of its immediacy.
    * Impediment → positive condition of our access to Truth: the Truth of a thing emerges because the thing is not accessible to us in its immediate self-identity.

Determinate reflection:

* 'Essence' itself is nothing but the self-rupture, the self-fissure of the appearance.
    * The fissure between appearance and essence is internal to the appearance itself, reflected in the domain of appearance.
* Redoubling: not only must the essence appear, articulate its inner truth, in a multiplicity of determinations, it must appear for the appearance itself - as essence in its difference to appearance, in the form of a phenomenon which gives body to the nullity of phenomena as such.
    * E.g. the State is a rational totality, but it establishes itself as an effective sublation-mediation of all particular contents only by embodying itself in the contingent individuality of the Monarch.
* The element which embodies again, which gives positive form to the very movement of sublation of all positivity, is '*reflexive determination*'.
* Logic of reflection and the 'absolute' subject are identical.
    * This subject is no longer attached to presupposed substantial contents but posits its own substantial presuppositions.
    * Redoubling of the reflection constitutes the subject: subject posits the substantial 'essence' presupposed in the external reflection through redoubling.

### Positing the presuppositions

'Beautiful soul' as 'figure of consciousness':

* Falsity lies in the mode of activity implied by the position of inactivity: the beautiful soul structures the 'objective' social world in advance so that it is able to assume the role of the fragile, innocent and passive victim.
* The real act precedes the particular activity; it consists in the previous restructuring of our symbolic universe into which our particular act will be inscribed.
* E.g. suffering mother: 'silent sacrifice' is her imaginary identification, gives consistency to her self-identity.
    * Lacan's communication: the speaker gets back from the recipient his own message in its inverted, true meaning. Mother's groaning is a demand "keep on exploiting me!"
        * True meaning: she is ready to sacrifice everything but the sacrifice itself.
    * Constituted vs constitutive identification:
        * Ideal ego (constituted): fragile, passive victim.
        * Ego-ideal (constitutive): identification with the formal structure of the intersubjective field which enables her to assume this role.
        * Hegel: the Truth is in the form, the formal act, the 'beautiful soul' structures its social reality in advance, then overlooks his or her formal responsibility for the given state of things.
            * E.g. Sartre vs French Communists:
                * Sartre rejects all bourgeois content, but the form of bourgeois subjectivity remains.

Hegel: Action qua actualization is the pure form of will- conversion of a reality that is into a reality that results from action.

* For the reality to appear to us as the field of our own activity, we must conceive it in advance as 'converted' - we must conceive ourselves as formally responsible-guilty for it.
* *Posited presuppositions*: positive-empirical activity is possible only if the subject structures his perception of the world in advance in a way that opens the space for his intervention- only if he retroactively posits the very presuppositions of his activity, of his 'positing'.

Hegel vs Marx:

* Marx: the collective subject first transforms the given objectivity by means of the effective-material process of production; gives it 'human form', then, reflecting the results of his activity, he formally perceives himself as the author of its world.

* Hegel: before the subject 'actually' intervenes in the world, he most formally grasp himself as responsible for it.
    * E.g. Antigone:
        * The universality which the individual as such attains is pure being, death; state reached immediately, in the course of Nature, not the result of an action consciously done.
        * Funeral turns it into something done, duty of the member of a Family is to assert in it the right of consciousness.
        * Subject symbolically repeats the process of natural disintegration, pretends that this process resulted from his own free decision.
            * Lacan: the subject confers the form of a free act on an 'irrational', contingent natural process in symbolization, forced choice.

Conferring the form of a free act; Hegel and Evil

* Before 'the Fall': human nature itself is innocent, Evil exists only when we have free choice, the subject.
* In culture, man becomes retroactively responsible of his own nature.
    * Human nature changes into its own opposite (innocent → pure Evil)
    * As soon as the universal form of the Spirit comprises natural contents, the subject is formally responsible for it
        * 'Choosing what is given'
        * External → determinate reflection: subject posits the presuppositions of his positing.
            * Positing of presuppositions = gesture of formal conversion

Hegel: **substance is subject**.

* Kantian-Fichtean 'finite' subject is that of practical activity, mediating the give objective reality to which he is bound.

    * Can never entirely 'mediate' the given objectivity, he is always bound to some transcendental presupposition (Thing-in-itself).
* Hegelian 'absolute' subject posits these very presuppositions through the act of choosing what is given.
    * What is added to the Kantian subject is a formal, empty gesture; act of pure feigning.
    * Lacan: 'empty gesture' is the signifier in which we find the constitutive act of symbolization.
* In dialectical process,* everything has already happened*, all that is going on is a pure change of form through which we take note of the fact that *what we arrived at has always already been*.
    * 'Subject' is the name for the empty gesture which must be added for the 'content' itself to achieve its full effectivity.
    * E.g. the Monarch:
        * Without it, the State would still be a substantial order.
        * Monarch is point of subjectivation, performing formal gesture of taking upon himself the decrees proposed by others, adding pure form of subjectivity.

Paradox of the phallic signifier

* Lacan: it is a signifier of this act of formal conversion by means of which the subject assumes the given reality as his own work.
* 'Everything depends on me, but for all that I can do nothing'.
    * St Augustine:
        * Sexuality is not sin, it is the punishment for the sin.
        * If man has strong will and self-control, he can master the movement of all parts of his body; all parts except one- the erection of the phallus.
    * Phallus joke: the phallus is the lightest object because it can be elevated by mere thought.
    * 'Phallus' designates the juncture at which the radical externality of the body joins the pure interiority of our thought.
        * Hegelian: unity of opposites; immediate passage of one extreme into its opposite.

### Presupposing the positing

Usual interpretation of positing → external reflection:

* Positing reflection is the activity of the essence (pure movement of mediation) which posits the appearance
* But, positing as 'mere appearance' is bound to the world of appearance, needs appearance as something already given.
    * Reflection presupposes the positive world of appearance as the starting point of its activity of mediating it, of positing it as 'mere appearance'.
    * E.g. 'ciriticism of ideology':
        * 'Unmasks' a theoretical edifice by enabling us to 'see through it'; "it is just an ideological appearance".
        * Purely negative movement which presupposes a 'spontaneous', 'non-reflected' ideological experience.
* Passage is the activity of positing taking note of its presuppositions; presuppositions external to the movement of reflection.

Heinrich: dialectic of positing and presupposing still falls within the category of 'positing reflection'.

* Fichte as philosopher of positing reflection: the subject 'posits' the given positivity of objects by means of productive activity. This positing remains bound to its presuppositions- the positively given objectivity upon which it performs its negative activity.
* Positing → external reflection: Not only the essence presupposes the objective world as its basis, *the essence also presupposes itself as its own other, in the form of externality, of something objectively given in advance in the form of immediacy.*
    * External reflection: the essence -movement of absolute mediation, pure, self-referential negativity- presupposes ITSELF in the form of an Entity existing in itself, excluded from the movement of mediation.
        * The essence presupposes itself in the form of otherness, in the form of some alien substance.
        * E.g. religious alienation: man presupposes himself in the form of an external substantial Entity; projects his innermost essence into an alien Being.
            * 'God' is man himself, perceived in the form of externality as belonging to some strange Entity existing in itself.
* We can only speak of the fissure separating the essence from appearance only in so far as the essence is split, presupposing itself as something alien, as its own Other.
    * 'Substance is subject': the 'substance' is the essence in so far as it reflects itself in the world of appearance, in phenomenal objectivity.
    * The 'subject' is substance in so far as it is itself split and experiences itself as some alien, positively given Entity.
        * 'Subject' is the name for the inner distance of 'substance' towards itself, the name for the empty place from which the substance can perceive itself as something 'alien'.
    * Essence can appear only in so far as it is already external to itself.

External → determinate reflection

* Usual interpretation: presuppositions are already posited, reflexive movement which retroactively posits its own presuppositions.
    * E.g. 'nature', the presupposed object of activity, is by its own nature the object for the subject's activity; its ontological status is determined by the horizon of the process of production.
        * It is in advance posited as a presupposition of subjective positing.
* Double meaning of 'reflection' in Hegel; reflection is always on two levels:
    * 1. Simple relation between essence and appearance: appearance 'reflects' the essence where the essence is the negative movement of mediation which sublates and at the same time posits the world of appearing. 
        * Essence posits the objectivity as 'mere appearance' and at the same time presupposes it as the starting point of its negative movement.
    * 2. The relationship between the essence as self-referential negativity, as the movement of absolute mediation, and the essence insofar as it presupposes itself in the inverse-alienated form of some substantial immediacy, as some transcendent entity excluded from the movement of reflection ('external' reflecting which does not concern the essence itself).
        * Reflection redoubled; essence reflects itself in the form of its own presuppositions, of a given-immediate substance.
        * *Essence presupposes itself as positing.*
* Passage is in: the image of the substantial-immediate, positively given essence is* nothing but* the inverse-alienated reflection of the essence as pure movement of self-referential negativity.
* Reflection (2) is the condition of reflection (1): the reflection of the essence into itself opens up the space for the appearance in which the hidden essence can reflect itself.
* Determinate reflection: *the subject must presuppose himself as positing*.
    * E.g. the Monarch:
        * Subtantial State determines social relations.
        * Subjects overcome alienation by recognizing the State as 'their own work', reflecting free subjectivity into the State at the point of the Monarch.
        * Freedom: subjects are free agents only by means of redoubling, projecting their freedom into the substance opposed to them; into the Monarch.
            * Subjects only by presupposing that the social substance is already in itself a subject (Monarch) to whom they are subjected.
* 'Substance becomes subject' centered in the One, the individual performing the empty gesture of subjectivation.
* Christianity; for freedom, it must already have taken place in God as his incarnation.
    * Protestanism; the condition of our subjective freedom ('positing) is that it must be reflected in advance into the substance itself, as its own 'reflexive determination'.
* Psychoanalysis:
    * 'Empty gesture' posits the big Other, pre-symbolic Real → symbolized reality. Through it the subject presupposes the existence of the big Other.
    * Subjective destitution: *subject no longer presupposes himself as subject.*
        * Assumes the non-existence of the big Other
        * Keeps open the gap between the Real and its symbolization.
