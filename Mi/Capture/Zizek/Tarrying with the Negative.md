# Introduction

Ceausescu's overthrow in Romania, national flag with Communist star cut out
* Open character of a historical situation in its becoming; intermediate phase between two Master-Signifiers.
* The hole in the big Other, symbolic order, became visible for a brief moment.
* The enthusiasm of the masses was over this hole and not a positive ideological project.
* The duty of the critical intellectual is to occupy all the time the place of the hole, to maintain distance toward every reigning Master-Signifier.
    * The discourse of the analyst emerges briefly in the passage from one discourse to anther; the aim of this discourse is to "produce" the Master-Signifier, i.e. render visible its "produced", artificial, contingent character.

Maintaining distance to the Master-Signifier characterizes the basic attitude of philosophy.
* Socrates as first philosopher, refuses to be identified with *agalma*, the unknown ingredient responsible for the Master's charisma, and persists in the void filled out by agalma.
* Philosophy begins with the question of how is what we encounter as actual also possible.
    * Step back from actuality into possibility: power to abstract from the starting point in order to reconstruct it on the basis of its presuppositions, its transcendental "conditions of possibility"; requires the suspension of the Master-Signifier.
        * Derrida as "transcendental" philosopher: the writing supplement to logos is its condition of possibility.
        * Lacan as "transcendental" philosopher: conditions of possibility of desire.
            * Lacan dismisses philosophy but every post-Hegelian philosophy (analytical, phenomenology, Marxism) attempts to "deconstruct" something referred to as the classical philosophical corpus.
            * Lacan opposes philosophy qua antiphilosophy, return to philosophy?

Breaks in philosophy are reactions to relativistic attitudes which threatened to demolish the traditional corpus of knowledge:
* Plato: Sophists' logical argumentation undermined the mythical foundations of the traditional mores. Plato accepts argumentation.
* Kant: Empiricists (Hume) undermined the foundation of the Leibnizian rationalist metaphysics. Kant accepts burial of the traditional metaphysics.
* Solution is a new founding gesture which surmounts the relativism by way of its own radicalization.
    * Lacan accepts the deconstructionist motif of radical contingency but asserts his commitment to Truth *as contingent*.

# I COGITO The Void Called Subject*

## 1 "I or He or It (the Thing) Which Thinks"

### The Noir Subject...

Classic film noir vs 1980s noir (combining it with another genre):
* Is noir a predicate that entertains toward the crime universe the same relationship as toward comedy or western, so that finding its strongest application in the crime film is historical contingency?
* Detective noir arrives at its truth only by way of its fusion with another genre, science fiction (*Blade Runner*) or the occult (*Angel Heart*).
    * The outcome of the quest for the protagonist is the undermining of self-identity masterminded by an all-powerful agency.
    * Post-modern world, Capital colonizes all, even intimate memories are planted, what remains is substanceless subjectivity
        * Proletarian?
    * The subversive effect (blurring of the line of distinction between humans and androids) hinges on the narrative closure (bad guy hands unicorn), the loop by means of which the beginning metaphorically augurs the end.
* Recollection:
    * Classic detective noir; amnesia is followed by integration into the field of intersubjectivity.
    * Blade Runner: recollection designates total loss of the hero's symbolic identity.

### ... Out of Joint

Kant: impossibility of locating the subject in the "great chain of being" into the Whole of the universe. Subject is "out of joint": constitutively lacks its own place ($).

Descartes, the "out of joint" state is _concealed_:
* "Classical episteme"; epistemological field regulated by the problematic of representations.
* Does not conceive of the *cogito* as correlative to the whole of reality as the point external to reality.
* The Cartesian *cogito* is a representation which leads us to other, superior representations.
    * First, subject is deficient, doubt as sign of imperfection
    * Then, representation of a perfect being free of incertitude.
    * Perfection doesn't come from imperfection so God is guaranteer of reality etc.
    * *Cogito* is part of reality and not yet correlative to the whole of reality.
* Topological discord between the form "I think" and the substance which thinks
    * Analytical proposition on the identity of the logical subject of thought vs the synthetical proposition on the identity of a person qua thinking thing-substance.
    * Subject of enunciation vs subject of enunciated
    * Experiential reality vs existence qua logical construction
        * Kant's I of transcendental apperception is necessary and impossible
            * Lacanian real
            * Formula of fantasy; "I think" only insofar as I am inaccessible to myself qua noumenal Thing which thinks.
                * Fantasy object (a) fills out the void of the Thing which is originally lost.
            * The lack of intuited content is constitutive of the I, the inaccessibility of the I of its own "kernel of being" makes it an I.
                * Kant yields to conceiving the relationship between the I of pure apperception and the I of self-experience as the relationship between a Thing-in-itself and an experiential phenomenon.
            * The empty form of thought coincides with being, which lacks any formal determination of thought.
                * The paradox of self-consciousness is that it is possible only against the background of its own impossibility.
                    * Notion of self-consciousness implies subject's self-decenterment.
            * Kant's metaphysics aims to heal the wound of the primordial repression; inaccessibility of the "Thing which thinks" by allocating to the subject a place in the "great chain of being".
                * LOSES freedom since noumenal self is inaccessible and Kant says freedom is noumenal Thing
    * Inconsistency with I of* pure apperception = noumenal Self* (Thing which thinks)
        * Phenomenal I (empirical subject) would be conceived of something which *appears to the noumenal subject* in the guise of an object of experience as well as the *appearance of the noumenal subject*.
        * If the noumenal subject* appears to itself*, the distance that separates appearance from noumena falls away.
    * Difference between the inaccessibility of the noumenal Self and of any object of perception: "I think" must also remain empty of the phenomenal level.
        * I's apperception is by definition devoid of any intuitional content.
        * Paradox of auto-affection: if I were given to myself phenomenally, as an object of experience, I would simultaneously have to be given to myself noumenally.
            * *Discursive vs intuitive intellect*
                * The subject is affected by things-in-themselves and he makes use of the discursive intellect (network of formal transcendental categories) to structure the multitude of formless affects into objective reality.
                * Structuring is his own "spontaneous" autonomous act.
                * If I were to possess an intuition of myself qua "Thing which thinks", I would lose the feature which makes me an I of pure apperception; I would cease to be the spontaneous transcendental agent that constitutes reality.
                    * Ethical: if I were to have a direct insight into God's nature, this would abrogate the notion of ethical activity.
            * *Transcendental object* qua correlate to the I of pure apperception:
                * Transcendental object is completely indeterminate thought of something in general, confers objective validity upon all empirical concepts in general relation to an object.
                * Marks the point at which the general form of every possible object reverts to the empty representation of the "object in general".
                * Undermines distinction between the formless stuff which descends from the transcendent Thing and the transcendental form by means of which the subject molds this intuited stuff into reality since it is an object "created" by the subject", an intelligible form which is its own stuff.
                * Metonymical object; its space is opened up by the simultaneous actual finitude and potential infinitude of our experience.
                * Guarantees that transcendental categories will refer to all possible future objects of experience.
                * Thing in itself vs transcendental object:
                    * Thing in itself is pure presupposition
                    * Transcendental object is purely posited by the subject.
                    * Lacan: Real qua Ding vs objet petit a (metonymical object which gives a body to the lack of positive objects).
                    * Transcendental object is not noumenal; insofar as it functions as a metonymical place-holder of the objectivity in whole, it is an object which, if given to me in intuition, would simultaneously have to be given to me as it is in itself.
                * Transcendental object and subject:
                    * Transcendental object is metonymical; it stands for the infinite series of phenomena
                    * Subject is metaphorical; its void holds the place of the inaccessible noumenal "Thing-which-thinks"

### From Kant to Hegel

Ambiguity of Kant's transcendental object (and subject) as a Thing or as something which is neither phenomenal nor noumenal is **a necessary equivocality**; if we choose any of the two poles of the alternative, Kant's system disintegrates.
* If transcendental I is noumenal Thing-self, the noumenal Self phenomenally appears to itself and the difference between phenomena and noumenal dissolves.
    * Fichte and Schelling; "I" becomes singular subject-object given to itself in the "intellectual intuition", "the eye which sees itself".
* If the I of apperception, autonomous agent of the constitution of reality is NOT noumenal; the difference between phenomena and noumena dissolves again in Hegel's way.

Hegel radicalizes the split that separates discursive intellect (the level of the Notion) from intuition.
* Kant: transcendental categories mold the affects which originate in noumenal things into "objective reality".
    * Problem in radical finitude of the affects, they are never "all" (totality is inaccessible).
* Hegel: problem is NOT the finitude of affects but the abstract character of thought itself. Thought needs affects, it is *abstract-formal, hasn't yet achieved* *"absolute form".*
* *Transcendental object*:
    * Index of deficiency on the side of intuition → index of the deficiency of the very discursive form.
    * *"There is no metalanguage"*: it is never possible for us to occupy the neutral place from which we could measure the distance that separates our semblance of knowledge from the In-itself of Truth.
        * Every tension between Notion and reality (extra-notional experience) is already an intra-notional tension, implies a minimal notional determination of "otherness".
        * Our search for a pure presupposition, unaffected by the subject's spontaneous activity,  produces an entity which is pure positedness.
        * What appears in and to our experience as the extra-notional surplus, as the "otherness" of the object irreducible to the subject's notional framework is always-already the fetishistic, "reified" (mis)perception of an inconsistency of the notion to itself.
        * The measure we use to test the truth of our knowledge-claims is always caught in the process of testing: if knowledge is proved inadequate, we also need to replace the measuring-rod of Truth, the In-itself which our knowledge failed to attain.
            * Adorno: failed mediation between sociology and psychology.
                * In Kantian terms, antinomical;
                    * Failure of deducing sociology from psychology (struggle of anonymous social forces are objectivization of concrete interpersonal relationships, individual projects).
                    * Failure of deducing psychology from sociology (psychological self-experience is mere imaginary effect-reflection of objective social structures and processes).
                    * Failures demonstrate that we touch the real, epistemological failure registers an antagonism that pertains to the kernel of the object itself (the separation/abyss is fundamental feature of modern society).
* Hegel's absolute, self-relating negativity (subject) is the purely negative gesture of limiting phenomena without providing any positive content which would fill out the space beyond the limit.
* The Absolute is Subject and Substance:
    * NOT "becoming-subject of the substance"
        * Subjectivization of the object always has remainder
        * This remainder is the correlative to the being of the subject:* objet petit a* is the surplus of the Substance, "bone" which resists subjectivization.
* "Subject" (as empty from of a "container" which remains after all the content was subjectivized) and "object" are the two sides of the same leftover, conceived either in the modality of form (subject) or in the modality of content (object)
    * *Objet petit a is the "stuff" of the subject qua empty form.*

### The Nonequivalent Exchange

Infinite judgement vs negative judgement:
* NOT negative judgement succeeding infinite judgement as a more concrete form of dialectical unity-within-difference.
* Infinite judgment (indeterminate negation, affirming non-predicate) brings forth the truth of negative judgment.

**Logic of exchange:**
* Negative judgment is equivalent exchange; we get another positively determined domain (domain of nonsensible intuition)
* Infinite judgment; pure loss, we get nothing in exchange.

Logic of exchange in dialectic of *Bildung* (culture-education) in *PoS*:
* Starting point: alienation, split between subject (noble consciousness) and substance (State)
    * Exchange: alienation (yielding substantial content to the Other) for honor (honor of serving the common Good embodied in the State).
* Mediation: Noble consciousness *alienates its pure For-itself *(silent honorable serving of the State) in language qua medium of the universality of thought (flattery to the Monarch)
    * Substance is subjectivized, changes from unattainable State to wealth qua substantial content which already is at our disposal (money for flattery).
    * Impersonal State → absolute Monarch
* *Appearance of equivalent exchange;* for sacrificing further substance, subject receives honor, wealth, language of Spirit and insight etc.
    * Actually, at "absolute freedom". subject gets nothing in exchange for everything. His alienation becomes an abstract negation which offers no positive determinate content in exchange.
        * E.g. Jacobinical Reign of Terror
    * *Speculative-dialectical reversal:* self-consciousness has to internalize negativity, the Nothingness which appears as an abstract, external threat and recognize in it the kernel of it own being.
        * Subject is infinite power of absolute negativity/mediation.
            * Vs. Biological life, which does not contain its own negation.
            * Absolute freedom (revolutionary citoyen) → Kantian moral subject; external negativity of Terror is internalized into the power of moral Law.
                * Free Will acts in accordance with the universal moral law, not pathological motivations.
        * Absolute freedom's negation is death without meaning, terror of the negative that contains nothing positive.
            * This negation in real existence is the universal will which can give nothing in return for the sacrifice. For that reason it is one with self-consciousness.
            * Universal will is the pure positive because it is the pure negative.

Criticisms of internalization of negativity:
* Deconstructionist: external revolutionary Terror → pressure of moral conscience hinges on closed economy which enables us to domesticate radical Externality of the Terror.
    * BUT, this actually gives rise to parasitic foreign body in the kernel of the subject's being.
    * External revolutionary Terror would not be able to hold the subject in check were he not already terrorized from within by superego-agency.
        * Kantian subject.
    * Negation of negation: external obstacle reveals itself to be an inherent hindrance.
* Marxist: Hegel's hidden positivism, repetition of the Protestant gesture of dislocating actual social freedom into "inner" moral freedom. "Reconciliation" qua internalization of negativity is renunciation, acceptance of irrational social conditions.
    * *Marx's closed economy:* proletarian as substanceless subjectivity.
        * Proletarian revolution as materialist version of Hegelian reconciliation of subject and substance. The collective subject is bound to render transparent and control the process of production and social reproduction in its entirety.
        * Relies on closed economy of the dialectical reversal (absolute subjectivity is elavated into the productive ground of all entities, "substance becomes subject)
            * BUT, reconciliation is the acknowledgment that the dimension of Subjectivity is inscribed into the core of Substance in the guise of irreducible lack which prevents it from achieving full self-identity.
            * Substance as subject: ontological crack denounces every notion of the universe qua totality of the "great chain of being" as a semblance.
    * Hegel as "absolute idealist" is a displacement of Marx's own disavowed ontology.
        * Ambiguity of Capital:
            * Capital as alienated Substance of historical process, the non-being of substanceless subjectivity.
                * Revolution is act where Subject appropriates to himself his alienated substantial content.
            * Capital as Substance which became subject, not empty abstract universality but an universality reproducing itself through circular self-mediation and self-positing
                * Capital as money which begets more money.

### Money and Subjectivity

Revolutionary Terror is the point where subject gets nothing in exchange for his sacrifice. 

* Negation is not determinate but absolute.

* Subject encounters itself as the subject qua cogito, negativity prior to every act of exchange.
* Revolutionary Terror *(S)* → Kantian subject *($)*
    * S: subject is substantial entity, identical to particular content threatened by external pressure of Terror's abstract and arbitrary negativity.
    * $: subject is the void of absolute negativity to whom pathological/particular positive content appears as "posited", ultimately contingent.
        * Emerges from the structure of exchange: the "nothing" I get from the Other in exchange for sacrificing my pathological particularity is myself qua $, empty point of self-relating.

Genesis of self-consciousness and the modern notion of paper money:

* Intermediate term, "imaginary money" ("bank-money"; gold coin not yet devalued by use, but it existed only as imaginary point of reference) is necessary.
    * Money entered into a relation with itself and became a commodity; duplication into good and bad gold money made it possible to measure the "price of money itself".
    * Imaginary money was rooted in the signature of particular payee, individual merchant.
        *  To arrive at paper money today, the promise with concrete names has to be depersonalized into a promise made to the anonymous "bearer".
            * Subject who recognizes itself as the anonymous "bearer" is the subject of self-consciousness: the subject has to relate itself to an empty bearer and perceive his positive empirical content "person" as contingent variable.
            * S → $

### From Subject to Substance... and Back

Nominalist Marxist (Feuerbach, Marx) criticism of Hegel as "idealist mystification":
* Hegel transposes multitude of intersubjective relations into the relationship of subject-individual to Substance, then transposes this relationship into that of the Substance to itself.
* ACTUALLY: subject is the name for the externality of the Substance to itself, misperceiving itself through human eyes as the inaccessible-reified Otherness.
    * Substance appears to subject as alien-external-inaccessible is actually self-splitting of the Substance itself.

Psychoanalysis: problem is unsolvable if we insist on the individual or Society as organic self-enclosed Whole. First step is relating social antagonism with the splitting constitutive of the subject.
* *Communication*: I can communicate with the Other insofar as I am already in myself split, cannot ever truly communicate with myself; the Other is the decentered Other Place of my own splitting.
    * I am propelled to communicate in hopes that I will receive the truth about my own desire from them.
    * The common ground that allows cultures to talk to each other is some shared deadlock, they communicate insofar as they can recognize in each other a different answer to the same fundamental antagonism.

Hegelian act always involves a moment of self-objectivization, externalization.
* To *"pass to the act" *means to assume one's role in the game of the *"cunning of reason".*
    * Analytical *la passe*: subjective destitution, I am only what I am for the others, which is why I have to renounce the fantasy-support of my being, my hidden treasure inaccessible to others.
* The problem is not the act's necessary ultimate failure (due to the interference of the Other subverting every intended meaning) but success which would bring catastrophe (either suicide, transformation of the subject into a thing) or lapse into madness (misperception of the Law of my Heart as the Law of the World).
    * If the subject survives his act, he is compelled to organize its ultimate failure, to avoid totally identifying with it.

**Cunning of reason**:
* Commonplace: we interpose between the objet and ourselves another objet and let them interact freely while we keep a safe distance.
    * E.g. Adam Smith's "invisible hand of the market"
    * The particular is too too trifling value compared with the general. The Idea pays the penalty of determinate existence and corruptibility from the passions of individuals.
* Ultimately impossible: determinate subjects cannot occupy the place of the cunning of reason and exploit another's passions without paying the price for his exploitation.
    * Cunning of reason is always redoubled: the artisan who exploits nature by way of the "cunning of reason" is in turn exploited by the "objective spirit" (the true aim of the process of social production is not satisfaction of individual needs but the development of productive forces).
    * E.g. God: Crucifixion as the point at which the divine Idea cannot remain in the background uninjured.

### The Subject as "Vanishing Mediator"

Subject is the "vanishing mediator" in the sense of the Lacanian Real; the structure of an element which isn't actually present and is as such inaccessible to our experience, nonetheless has to be presupposed, retroactively constructed if all other elements are to retain their consistency.
* Dialectic of Lord (Master) and Bondsman → Stoicism:
    * At first, Knowledge belongs to the Bondsman in the guise of "savoir-faire", practical skills to provide satisfaction for the Lord-Master.
    * Technical know-how → Thought: Slave becomes aware of how Thought as such is already the form of every possible objectivity.
        * External finality → self-finality
    * Lacan: philosophy emerges when the Master appropriates to himself the Slave's know-how and transforms it into philosophical ontology, a universal episteme disengaged from utilitarian interests.
        * Stoicism is the philosophy of the Slave who posits his inner freedom as the only level at which he is equal to the Master.
    * The position of Philosopher qua "master who thinks" is inherently impossible and as such is a mere fantasy of philosophy.
        * There are no 'philosopher-kings'
* Phrenology → active Reason
    * Ends with infinite judgment "Spirit is a bone"
    * Then, active Reason endeavors to transpose the in-Itself of the observing Reason into its For-itself.
        * By means of activity of molding objects, subject "changes into an object", acquires existence independent of his subjective Inwardness.
        * Compulsive neurosis in the otherwise hysterical dialectical process: subject escapes into activity, transposes what he already possessed into an infinite task to be gradually realized through his continuous effort.
            * *Acting out*: subject puts off the uneasy encounter with what is already here (the Real); transposes his identity with the dead inert object into the goal of his infinite activity
            * Aim of flight is to avoid  confronting the uncanny abyss of the subject qua $, the void of absolute self-contradiction.
    * Brief, necessary moment between naive phrenology and active Reason at which consciousness has a foreboding of the speculative truth of phrenology but is unable to endure it and therefore runs away from it into activity.

### Limitation Precedes Transcendence

Relationship between the Real and the objet petit a:
* Obvious solution: The Real is the substance of jouissance radically external to the symbolic order and the objet a is semblance of being.
    * Kant: inaccessible substance and the transcendental object.
    * Transcendental object is the ground of thinking conceived in the mode of our thinking; unknown X that has to be thought of as an X (sensuously unfulfilled conception) if our experience is to retain its consistency.
        * *Gedankending*: the In-itself insofar as it is for the consciousness, the way the In-itself is present in thought.
* *PROBLEM:* substantialization of the Thing, conceiving the transcendental object as fullness is present in our experience in the guise of empty thought devoid of any intuitive content.
    * Secondary status of the transcendental object
    * Lacanian real is both substantial kernel that precedes and resists symbolization as well as the left-over, posited-produced by symbolization itself.
* There is no substance of enjoyment without, prior to, the surplus of enjoyment. Substance is a mirage retroactively invoked by the surplus.
    * Illusion of the a qua surplus-enjoyment is that it invokes the expression of some substantial Real behind it.
        * E.g. pere-jouissance
* *Limitation precedes transcendence*: only phenomena and its limitation "actually exists", das Ding is a phantasm which fills out the void of the transcendental object.
* Lacan: the distinction is sustained only within the space of desire as structured by the intervention of the signifier which brings about the split separating the accessible, symbolically structured reality from the void of the Real, the index of the lost Thing (mythical object whose encounter would bring about the full satisfaction of the drive).
    * *Lack of the Thing is not epistemological*, pertains to the paradoxical logic of desire (the Thing emerges in the gesture of its loss).
    * The unattainable character of the Thing-jouissance is perceived as unknowableness the moment we substantivize it and assume that it ontologically precedes its loss.
    * Kantian sublime does not involve the breakdown of the field of phenomena, results from a perspective-illusion. What breaks down is the notion that behind the field of phenomena lies some inaccessible positive substantial Thing.
        * The sublime object is pure semblance, both the surface grimace and something more real than reality itself. It gives body to a boundary which fixes the limits of what we experience as reality by holding the place of what has to be excluded, foreclosed.
* Hegel responds to Kantian split:
    * "Intellectual intuition" belongs to the level of Understanding (and not dialectical Reason), presents the synthesis of the Sensible and the Intellectual as something that takes place in a separate domain beyond their splitting.
    * Actual synthesis is already effectuated in the splitting since the suprasensible Idea is NOTHING BUT the inherent limitation of the intuited phenomena.
    * Sensible intuitions must be supplemented by the sensuously unfulfilled conception of an X (objet a) for an object to emerge in the field of experience since the void of X is a correlative, a "reified" effect of the subject's synthetic act of apperception.

### "Total Recall": Knowledge in the Real

**Noir**: The void standing for the irreducible gap between the I of apperception and the noumenal "Thing which thinks" opens up the possibility of** "paranoiac" attitude** (I am an artifact in the hands of an unknown Maker).

*Blade Runner*: Tyrell is new father in post-industrial corporate late capitalism
* Cartesian Evil Genius: exerts domination not at the level of my symbolic identity but at the level of what I am qua "Thing which thinks".
* *Father: S1 → S2*
    * NOT Master-signifier whose name guarantees my symbolic identity
    * Knowledge which created me as its artifact.
    * At this moment I, the son, become a monster.
* *Subject of enunciation vs enunciated*; every enunciated content "that's me" is not "I"; I am only the void that remains, the empty distance toward every content.
    * It is only when I assume my replicant-status at the level of enunciated content that I become a truly human subject.
    * Subject is by definition *nostalgic, subject of loss*.
* Decenteredness of replicants is NOT decenteredness of subject of the signifier with regard to the big Other.
    * Blade Runner is NOT subjectivization of the replicants (constructing their place in the symbolic universe).
        * NOT Manipulation is ultimately doomed: Tyrell cannot foresee the way replicants will organize the implanted elements into a mythical narrative which will give rise to the hysterical question.
    * Lacan: the subject qua $ does NOT emerge with subjectivization-narrativization, it emerges at the moment when the individual loses its support in the network of tradition and coincides with the void that remains after the symbolic framework is suspended.
    * "Total recall" would amount to* knowledge in the real*, filling out the void which constitutes me qua $ (subject of self-consciousness), identifying myself as "he or it, the Thing which thinks."
        * Replicants are the impossible fantasy-formation of us human mortals; fantasy of a being conscious of itself qua Thing, of a being which does not have to pay for access to self-consciousness with $ (loss of substantial support).
        * Artificial intelligence:
            * Inversion of metaphor; modeling computers to match original human until the "model" is already a model of the original itself (human intelligence operates like a computer).
            * Question: how does the total simulation of thought differ from "real" thought?"
            * *Simultaneously impossible and prohibited*.
* Lacanian Real: the remainder which resists the reversal of metaphor (computer qua model of human brains → brains qua blood-and-flesh computer)
    * Reversal relies on realization of the metaphor: computers become the original paradigm imitated by blood-and-flesh reality.
        * Reality is always framed by fantasy: for something real to be experienced as part of "reality", it must fit the preordained coordinates of our fantasy-space.
    * Second definition: the Real is a surplus which resists any process of modeling, simulation or metaphoricization.
    * E.g. Alien as metaphor for AIDS
        * AIDS owes its impact not to its reality of illness but the extraordinary libidinal energy invested in it.
        * AIDS occupies a place in our ideological fantasy-space and the "alien" just materializes this fantasy-dimension which was from the beginning at work in the AIDS phenomenon.
* Our reality is based on the same exclusion of the Real as the computer-generated "virtual reality".
    * The fact that "a computer doesn't think" means that the price for our access to "reality" is that* something must remain unthought*.

## 2 *Cogito* and the Sexual Difference

### The Kantian Crack in the Universal

In Kant, as soon as the Thing-in-Itself is posited as unattainable, every universal is potentially suspended.
* Every universal implies a point of exception (singularity) at which its validity is canceled.
* This singularity is the Kantian subject (empty subject of the transcendental apperception).
* This singularity is why Kant's three critiques stumble against universalization.
    * Pure reason: antinomies emerge when we apply categories to the totality of the universe.
    * Practical reason: possibility of radical Evil which coincides with the Good as to its form.
    * Capacity of judging:
        * (1) opposition of aesthetics and teleology does not form a harmonious Whole: 
            * Beauty is purposefulness without purpose, designates the paradoxical point at which human activity starts to function as a spontaneous natural force.
            * Teleology deals with discerning hidden purposes in a nature submitted to blind mechanical laws, transcendental categories among which there is no place for purposefulness.
            * Sublime is the index of the failed synthesis of Beauty and Purpose, negative intersection of the two sets.
                * Sublime is the site of inscription of pure subjectivity whose abyss Beauty and Teleology endeavor to conceal by way of the appearance of Harmony.

Sublime and Beauty in ethics:
* Lacan's two facets of law:
    * (1) symbolic Ego-Ideal, law in its pacifying function, guarantee of social pact, intermediating Third which dissolves the impasse of imaginary aggresivity.
        * Beauty
    * (2) law in its superego dimension, "irrational" pressure, force of culpabilitization, agency in whose eyes we are a priori guilty and which gives body to the impossible imperative of enjoyment.
        * *Dynamical sublime*: I may be a tiny particle of dust, powerless in face of the raging forces of nature, yet this fury of nature pales in comparison with the absolute pressure exerted on me by the superego which humiliates me and compels me to act against my fundamental interests.
            * Paradox of autonomy: I am free and autonomous subject delivered from my pathological nature insofar as my feeling of self-esteem is crushed by the humiliating pressure of the moral Law.
* Sublime object fails as a symbol, it evokes its Beyond by the failure of its symbolic representation.
    * Sublime is the symbol of the nonpathological, ethical, suprasensible dimension insofar as it eludes the domain of Good: radical Evil, Evil as an ethical attitude.
        * E.g. Hannibal Lecter is a failed attempt to represent the idea of a Lacanian analyst.
            * Lecter's cruelty fails to capture the true dimension of the act of the analyst: by bringing about the traversal of fantasy, he steals the kernel of our being (objet a), secret treasure, denouncing it as a mere semblance.
            * The objet a is the fantasmatic "stuff of the I", that which confers on the $ the ontological consistency of a "person", semblance of a fullness of being.

Sublime and teleology:
* Sublime is nature in its purposeless raging, forces which do not serve anything.
    * Enjoyment: where nature doesn't know, it enjoys.
* Teleological observation discovers a presupposed knowledge in nature, "nature knows".

### The Christian Sublime, or, the "Downward-Synthesis"

Christian Sublime is opposite of Kantian sublime, *a contrario, *reduction of the representative content to the lowest imaginable level: Christ is miserable creature and his divine essence shines through more powerfully against this background.
* Hegel: the reduction to the nauseating "little piece of the real" is performative, productive of the spiritual dimension (spiritual depth generated by the distortion of the surface). The extreme discord between God and the lowest form of human existence *IS the divine power of absolute negativity*.
    * Christian God is the gap.
* Sublime: prohibition of representation (Jewish God) → acceptance of the most null representation.
* *Downward-synthesis:* concluding moment is not triumphant synthesis but the lowest point at which the very common ground of position and negation is worn away.
    * The order of universal symbolic mediation collapses into an inert left-over.
    * E.g. triad of Law
        * (1) reason as lawgiver, reason posits laws qua universal ethical precepts.
            * Eventually gains insight into the contingent content and possible conflictual nature of these laws.
        * (2) reason assumes reflective distance and limits itself to their testing.
        * (3) reason becomes aware of the empty, purely formal character of this procedure and its incapacity to procure actual spiritual substance filled out with concrete positive content.
        * Reason cannot posit or reflect upon laws without presupposing determinate ethical substance in a law which is in force simply because it is law.
            * History begins with our accepting that we are embedded in some historically specified* "spiritual substance"* (ethical substance qua presupposed medium which mediates the subject's attempts at reflective mediation).
    * Positing, external, *determinate reflection*: third moment is immediate acceptance of the given ethical substance. Triad of Law exemplifies the *breakdown of reflection*.
* Temporal manipulation: material which, presented in linear succession does not affect our sensitivity to the Sublime, acquires the aura of the "Sublime" the moment it undergoes a purely temporal manipulation.
    * Gaze of the living dead in *The Unbearable Lightness of Being*

### The "Formulae of Sexuation"

 Kantian antinomies designate the moment at which sexual difference is for the first time inscribed in the philosophical discourse in the guise of the difference in the two types of antinomies.
* Two types of antinomies in CPR:
    * Mathematical antinomies arise when categories are applied to the universe as a Whole.
        * Multitude accessible to sensible intuition,* *
        * coexistence of elements
        * Homogeneity: all elements belong to the same spatiotemporal series.
    * Dynamical antinomies emerge when we apply categories to objects which do not belong to the phenomenal order (God, soul).
        * Synthetic power which reaches beyond sensible intuition, 
        * necessary logical interconnection
        * Heterogeneity: we progress from effect to cause/ground.
* Double negation which defines the status of phenomena: noumenon is a non-phenomenon, limitation of phenomena, and the field of phenomena itself is never complete/whole.
    * Mathematical antinomies, "non-all" of the phenomenon: although there is no object outside the phenomenal field, this field is never "all".
        * Solution: both thesis and antithesis is false since the object to which the thesis attributes finitude/infinitude does not exist.
        * object
        * Theoretical reason aims at completing the causal chain
    * Dynamical antinomies, universality: logical connection of the phenomena in the universal causal nexus necessarily involves* exception, noumenal act of freedom*.
        * Solution: both can be true.
        * subject
        * Practical reason aims at suspending the causal nexus by way of free act which begins "out of itself" and cannot be explained by the preceding causal chain.
* Formulae of sexuation:
    * Diagonal pairs are not the same thing: the universal function implies a constitutive exception, the lack of exception to the function F prevents its universal span.
    * Human rights:
        * Masculine: every human being must enjoy the rights to....
        * Feminine: there must be nobody who is denied his or her specific rights.
    * Lacan: sexuality is the effect on the living being of the impasses which emerge when it gets entangled in the symbolic order.
    * Feminine-mathematical antinomies
    * Masculine-dynamical antinomies
    * Feminine "not-all":
        * NOT that woman is split between her true Nature and the imposed symbolic mask.
        * There is no exception and "woman" is the nonexistent "nothing" which nonetheless makes the existing elements "not-all".
        * Eludes the grasp of the phallic function insofar as there is nothing in her which is not submitted to it.
            * Masculine: man is dominated by the phallic function insofar as there is something in him which evades it.
* Logical priority of the non-all to the All (of the Limit to what lies Beyond).
    * Anti-Cartesian: the incomplete "causes" the complete, the Imperfect opens up the place subsequently filled by the mirage of the Perfect.

### "I Am Not Where I Think"

The solution to mathematical antinomy is the nonexistence of its object, "la Femme n'existe pas."

The void of the pure "I think" (vanishing mediator) precedes the Cartesian *res cogitans*: Cartesian* cogito* is masculine because it is not abstract enough.

Sexual difference: Cartesian *res cogitans* vs Kantian pure form of "I think".

Cogito as forced choice between thought and being:
* Choice of thought; the access to thought "I think" is paid for by the loss of being
* Choice of being; the access to "I am" is paid for by the relegation of thought to the Unconscious.
* Synchronous:
    * Masculine cogito results from the choice of being
    * Feminine cogito chooses thought and is reduced to the empty point of apperception prior to its "substantialization" in a res cogitans ("I think, therefore it ex-sists").
* Lacan's shift from "choice of thought" to "choice of being":
    * Sublime body: body of victim → body of executioner as object-instrument of the Other's jouissance.
        * Executioner acquires the status of objet a by way of transposing his subjective splitting onto his victim.
        * Antigone, ambiguous:
            * Ethics of desire --- sacrificing enjoyment for the sake of the purity of our desire.
            * Ethics of drive ---  desire itself as defense against enjoyment, mode of compromise.
                * Commitment to the sinthome which defines the contours of our relation to enjoyment.
* Lacan's shift from distancing to identification
    * Distancing from the imaginary fascination through the work of symbolic "mediation", then assumption of symbolic castration, then going through the fantasy.
        * Concluding moment of the psychoanalytic cure is a kind of exit.
    * Identification with the sinthome, the subject unreservedly yields to it, giving up the false distance which defines our everyday life.
* Neither version of the cogito choice is "Lacan's last word", we should maintain their irreducible antagonism as an index of the inscription of the sexual difference.

### Cogito as the Fantasy-Gaze

Masculine cogito chooses being, the "I am", yet what it gets is being which merely thought, not real being (cogito "ergo sum"), gets fantasy-being of a "person", the being in "reality" whose frame is structured by fantasy.

Feminine cogito chooses thought, the pure "I think", yet gets thought without predicates, coincides with pure being (hyperbolic point which is neither thought nor being).
* Jouissance feminine is nonexistent.


The subject constitutes itself by rejecting the substance of jouissance.
* Lacan's "the spirit is a bone": the pure "I think" takes place only when the subject endures the confrontation with the senseless stain of jouissance.
* Formula of fantasy: at the moment of my reduction to a pure cogito qua impossible gaze, a formless slime of the substance of jouissance had to emerge somewhere else.
    * Pure cogito, choice of thought, fantasy: in fantasy, I find myself reduced to the evanescent point of a thought.

Self-duplication of the gaze in fantasy: we are not immediately identified with our look but stand somewhere "behind" it.
* The gaze is concealed by an eye, by its very organ.


### "Self-consciousness Is an Object"

1st version: "I think, therefore it is." (fantasy, choice of thought)
* The Id is the "it is", vs Unconscious 
"I am, therefore it thinks":
* There is no I without the stain: "I am" only insofar as I am not where I think, only insofar as the picture contains a stain, only insofar as this stain remains a stain i.e. I don't recognize myself in it.
    * I perceive "normal" reality only insofar as the point at which the "it thinks" remains a formless stain.
* The Unconscious takes place only with the choice of being; it designates the "it thinks" which emerges the moment I "am", the moment the subject chooses being.
* The stain is NOT **objet petit a**: a is the gaze, point of view from which the stain can be perceived in its "true meaning".
    * The analyst occupies the place of **objet a**, he is supposed to know the true meaning of the stain.
    * In paranoia,** a** becomes visible, assumes empirical existence of an agency which "sees into me", is able to read my thought.
* **Objet petit a** stands for the point of self-consciousness.
    * Self-consciousness as such is decentered: the stain bears witness to the ex-sistence of decentered, external place where I do arrive at self-consciousness.
        * The decentered hard kernel which eludes my grasp is ultimately self-consciousness itself: self-consciousness is an external object out of my reach.
    * Self-consciousness is the opposite of self-transparency: I am aware of myself only insofar as outside of me a place exists where the truth about me is articulated.
        * My place and that of the stain cannot coincide
        * The stain cannot be abolished since it is the product/objective correlateive of my self-awareness.
    * *Sinthome*: stain correlative to the non-being of the subject.
* Doubling of self-consciousness provides the foundation of "intersubjectivity":
    * But asymmetrical: the "other" is originally an object, opaque stain.
    * No object exists prior to self-consciousness, the object emerges as the opaque kernel which has to be excluded if I am to gain awareness of myself.
        * The original intersubjective correlate of the subject is not another $, but S, full Other possessing what the subject constitutively lacks.
    * Intersubjectivity vs belonging to a community:
        * Intersubjectivity becomes possible with $ which needs S as correlative to its non-being, involves radical decenteredness: only when my self-consciousness is externalized in an object do I being to look for it in another subject. 
        * The Other as both impenetrable opaque other subject and neutral field in which I encounter other objects: I cannot conceive of myself as participating at some common substance, this substance necessarily opposes itself to me in the guise of the Other Subject.

### "I Doubt, Therefore I Am"

Cartesian doubt and compulsive (obsessive) neurotic doubt:
* Philosophization of clinical categories: existential-ontological positions.
* Lacan: I am only insofar as I doubt: the neurotic clings to his doubt as the only firm support of his being, is extremely apprehensive of the prospect of decision.
    * Uncertainty provides minimal ontological consistency.
    * What the subject fears to lose is doubt as such, uncertainty, the open state where everything is still possible.
        * The act has the status of object as it cuts short the indeterminacy which provides the distance that separates the subject from the world of objects.
* Kant as compulsive neurotic, the subject is tortured by hidden "pathological" considerations.
    * It is the stain of uncertainty which sustains the dimension of ethical universality.
    * Once the pathological stain is missing, the universal collapses into the particular.
        * Sadeian perversion: Kantian compulsive uncertainty → absolute certainty.

Anxiety and the desire of the Other: anxiety is aroused by the desire of the Other ("I do not know what object a I am for the desire of the Other")
* Uncertainty defines the subject: the subject "is" only as a "crack in the substance".


The position of the pervert vs the position of the analyst:
* Upper level of the discourse of the analyst produces the formula of perversion.
* Analyst functions as objet a for the analyst, blank screen onto which the analysand projects his or her fantasies.
* The pervert confirms the subject's fantasy whereas the analyst induces him to traverse it, to gain a minimal distance toward it by rendering visible the void (lack in the Other) covered up by the fantasy-scenario.

Perversion, "masochism" of the anal phase:
* Oral → anal: dialectical shift in the intersubjective symbolic economy.
    * Oral: satisfying of needs is mediated by the demand addressed to the Other.

    * Anal: adaptation of the subject's desire to the demand of the Other.
        * Object-cause of the subject's desire coincides with the Other's demand.
        * Satisfaction of need is subordinated to the demand of the Other.
        * Pleasure is prohibited insofar as it involves taking a direct satisfaction in the object. It is permitted only in the function of complying with the Other's demand.
        * I am allowed to enjoy something only insofar as it serves Theory qua my big Other.

### The Precipitous Identification

Althusser's "ideological interpellation" designates the retroactive illusion of always-already: misrecognition of the performative dimension.
* Act of recognition is a move aimed at resolving the subject's uncertainty as to its status.
* The subject is interpellated as x (some specific subject-position, symbolic identity or mandate) thereby eluding the abyss of $.
* Anticipatory character of the subject's symbolic identification:
    * Symbolic identification is form me to proclaim myself as X in order to overtake others who might expel me from the community of those who "belong to X".
    * Logical time, three prisoners, three possibilities:
        * One has white hat and the other two black hats
            * No time involved, "instant of the gaze"
        * Two white and one black: 
            * if mine is white: the other white would have stood up and gone if mine was black, so mine must be white
            * Time for understanding: I transpose myself into the reasoning of the other.
        * Three whites:
            * Double delay, interrupted gesture: they would all get up at the same time.
            * Delay → haste: noticing that they all share the same hesitation, they will jump to the conclusion that they are all in the same situation.
            * "Let me rush to the door before the others overtake me"
    * Third moment provides the true "genesis of the I"
        * Symbolic mandate: we never simply ascertain what we are, we become what we are by means of a subjective gesture.
        * Object → signifier: 
            * the hat is the object I am and its invisibility to me renders the fact that I can never get an insight into what I am as an object.
            * Symbolic identity fills out the void of the uncertainty as to my being.
                * Gesture: my objective social identity is established by means of subjective anticipation.
* Symbolic and death: symbolic identity allows me to "outpass myself into death".
    * Also functions as its opposite, is designed to forestall death.
        * Obsessive strategy: I hasten to assume death in order to avoid it.
    * What I actually overtake is objet a in myself; symbolic identification is a "flight forward" from the object that I am.
* Althusser's interpellation leaves out of consideration the anticipatory overtaking qua inherent reverse of this retroactivity.

Hysterical symptom: desperate endeavor to affirm himself, to be accepted as a partner in communication.
* The ultimate meaning of the symptom is that the Other should take notice of the fact that it has a meaning.


Computer lacks self-referentiality of meaning.
* Logical temporality: the signifier of reflective meaning (which "means" only the presence of meaning") allows us to overtake ourselves and establish our identity not in some positive content but a pure self-referential signifying form alluding to a meaning-to-come.
* Lack of the signifier → signifier of the lack
    * Malcolm X: replacing the Name-of-the-Father with the symbol of the unknown
    * The reference to the lost Origins enables the subject to elude the grasp of the imposed symbolic identity and to "choose freedom", the lack of fixed identity.

Every symbolic identification is ultimately identification with an X, "empty" signifier which stands for the unknown content.
* X stands for the loss of African Origins: the act of returning to "maternal" Origins is our renouncing them as lost.
* Malcolm X's gesture is the Oedipal gesture of substituting Name-of-the-Father for the desire of the mother.
    * Virtual character of the Name-of-the-Father: the paternal metaphor is an "X" in the sense that it opens up the space of virtual meaning.

# II ERGO The Dialectical Nonsequitur

## 3 On Radical Evil and Related Matters

### "Kant with Bentham"

The antagonistic tension which defines sexuality is not the polar opposition of two cosmic forces but a certain crack which prevents us from even consistently imagining the universe as a Whole. Sexuality points toward the supreme ontological scandal of the nonexistence of the universe.

**Vorstellungs-Repraesentanz: **the signifying representative of the missing representation.
* Kant's transcendental constitution:
    * The "universe" as the totality of beings, which includes us as its part, does not exist.
    * Vs skepticism, Kant: we can positively demonstrate that things-in-themselves cannot be of the same nature as phenomena, since antinomies emerge.
    * This illusion of the universe is necessary if our experience is to retain its consistency.
    * *"Transcendental Idea"* is the sheet of paper which patches up the gaps of reality.
        * Virtualized reality
        * Lacanian real is the hard kernel which does not yield to the virtualization, which is NOT a transcendental artifact.

Kant's theory of the necessary transcendental* Schein* and Bentham's theory of fictions:
* Common perception: Bentham's vulgar utilitarianism vs sublime ethic of duty for duty's sake.
* Kant = Bentham, Kant = Sade; Hegelian infinite judgement ascertaining the coincidence of the must sublime with the lowest (spirit is a bone).
* Bentham accomplished same purification that Hume realized in the domain of theoretical reason:
    * Instrumental definition of Good, "Good-in-itself" is nonsensical and self-contradictory.
    * Emptying the field of the Good of all substantial content.
* Kant started from the impossibility of determining the Good-in-itself within the field of possible experience, then conceives the Good at the level of form, as the universal form of our will.
* Theory of fictions: legal discourse, has to presuppose a series of entities whose status is fictitious (legal person, social contract, ignorance of law does not absolve from guilt)
    * Fictitious entities bear some relation to some real entity.
    * Two kinds of fictions: fictitious entities vs imaginary (fabulous) nonentities.
        * First (e.g. contract) is not imaginary representation, also serves as a tool for bringing about a series of real effects.
        * Second is imaginary representation, is less real than contract.
        * Lacanian distinction between the Symbolic and the Imaginary.
    * Fictions are inherent to language (discourse) as such.
        * Truth has the structure of fiction: the dimension of truth is opened up by the order of discourse which loses its consistency without the support of fictions.
        * It is possible to tell two kinds of fiction apart but we cannot renounce fiction and illusion.
        * *Transcendental Ideas*: regulative and not constitutive; they supplement reality, our knowledge of objective reality can be made consistent only by way of reference to Ideas.
            * It continues even after its deceptiveness has been exposed
                * E.g. Marx's "commodity-fetishism" warning.
        * Spinoza, error to truth: truth is stricto sensu error's truth, an insight into the process which generated error.

### Fantasy and Reality

Transcendental illusion qua fantasy-frame of reality
* Although reality is determined by reality-testing, reality's frame is structured by the left-overs of hallucinatory fantasy: the ultimate guarantee of our sense of reality turns on how what we experience as reality conforms to the fantasy-frame.
* There is no reality without its fantasmatic support;
    * Ideas are prime images (intuitions) created by reason, things of thought, precede our knowledge of things and the elements of thought.
* Ideas; self-created a priori things of thought.
    * *Ambiguity of Ideas* (at the same time noumenal Things and subjective regulative principles): extimate status of the Idea: paradoxical immediate coincidence of the noumenal Thing with Schein (the illusion which has no place in the constituted phenomenal reality). 
    * *Ambiguity of das Ding*:
        * The Thing is "what hurts", external traumatic X which derails the closed circulation of the Lust-Ich around hallucinatory objects, forcing it to give up the pleasure principle and to confront reality.
        * The Thing is simultaneously the subject's innermost kernel of being, what he must sacrifice in order to gain access to "external reality".

### "A Hair of the Dog That Bit You"

Paradox of symbolic fictions: they bring about the loss of reality AND provide the only possible access to reality.
* Lacan: "speech is able to recover the debt that it engenders"
    * Entry into the symbolic order, immediacy of the real is forever lost, the word entails the symbolic murder of the thing.
        * Hegel: negative-abstractive power of *Verstand *(analytical mortification-dismembering of what organically belongs together).
    * Fort-Da game:
        * First glance:
            * Child is traumatized by mother's unforeseeable departures, compensates for it by playing the game.
            * By way of symbolization, anxiety disappears, the price is the "substitution of things by words", of mother with its signifying representative (spool).
            * Entry into the universe of symbols is paid for by the loss of the incestuous object, of mother qua Thing.
        * Lacan:
            * The disappearing and reemerging spool is the sacrificed part of the subject itself, price is the subject's renunciation of his "pound of flesh".
            * The sacrifice takes place in myself; the object which compensates for the loss of the mother-Thing is part of myself, it stands for the loss of my own substantial fullness of being.
            * Symbolization means that I myself cease to be an object for my mother.
            * S → $
    * "Only the spear that smote you / can heal your wound" (Wagner, *Parsifal*)
        * Ecological crisis; only technology and science themselves can get us out of the deadlock into which they brought us.
        * Transference: the main hindrance to the successful remembrance of the traumatic past becomes the lever of the psychoanalytic cure's progress.
    * Postmodern doxa:
        * The idea that the symbolic order is able to square its debt in full epitomizes the illusion of the Hegelian Aufhebung.
        * The problem is in the fact that the symbolic debt is constitutive and as such irredeemable, never can be filled up by sense, sense is never "all".
    * What appears as a problem to an abstract approach is actually a necessary constituent of the very unproblematic state of things we are striving for.
        * No unproblematic state of things exists prior to problems. Getting rid of the problem means we lose what we wanted to save.
        * E.g. the state's interventions ('problem' for liberals) secures the normal functioning of the market.
    * Not only the proposed solution can be part of the problem, reproducing its true cause, but also what appears as a problem is actually its own solution.
        * E.g. the death of Christ; his failure was actually his triumph, reconciliation of man and God. In the lamentation over Christ's death, God is here qua Spirit, reconciliation is realized in its "mediated", true form.
    * Empty speech vs full speech:
        * NOT empty speech as non-authentic prattle and full speech authentic existential position of enunciation.
        * Password as the exemplary case of empty speech:
            * Pure gesture of recognition, enunciated content is indifferent.
            * Human speech is first the medium of mutual recognition of the speakers.
            * Password qua empty speech is what reduces the subject to the punctuality of the subject of the enunciation.
        * Empty speech creates the space for "full speech" by way of its distance toward the enunciate content which is posited in it as totally indifferent.
        * Only if you fully assume the void of the "empty speech" can you hope to articulate your truth in the "full speech".
* Hegel: the subject's radical estrangement from immediate substantial wealth opens up the space for the articulation of his/her subjective content. To posit the substantial content as "my own", I must first establish myself as pure, empty form of subjectivity devoid of all positive content.

### The Radical Evil

Insofar as the symbolic wound is the ultimate paradigm of Evil, radical Evil opens up the space for Good.
* Kant: presence of a positive counterforce to man's tendency toward Good, subject experiences moral Law as unbearable traumatic pressure.
    * Something exists which gives preference to egotistical, pathological leanings over the tendency to follow the moral Law.
    * *Radical Evil*: A priori propensity toward Evil.
        * The fact that I feel morally responsible for my evil bears witness to how I must have freely chosen my eternal character by giving preference to Evil.
    * *Rejecting diabolical Evil*; such acts are Evil as to their content but fulfill the formal criteria of an ethical act.
        * Don Giovanni's final refusal to repent.
* Evil is another name for the "death-drive", the fixation on some Thing which derails our customary life-circuit.
    * Evil introduces the radical reversal of the "natural" relationship, man wrests himself from animal instinctual rhythm.
* Kant and Schelling's formula: the possibility of Evil is founded in man's freedom of choice on account of which he can invert the "normal" relationship between universal principles of Reason and his pathological nature.
* Hegel: the possible space for Good is opened up by the original choice of radical Evil which disrupts the pattern of the organic substantial Whole.
    * The truly first choice is that between yielding to one's pathological leanings and choosing radical Evil.
    * Negative gesture of suspending the life-circuit.
* Kierkegaard: Evil is Good itself in the mode of becoming.
    * Good vs Evil is formal conversion "becoming" → "being"
* The wound is healed when the place of Evil is filled out by a "good" content.
    * Good qua "the mask of radical Evil" is ontologically secondary attempt to reestablish the lost balance.
    * E.g. Thomas More who refused to approve Henry VIII's divorce: although his motivations were "good", the formal structure of his act was radically evil, radical defiance which disregarded the Good of community.
* Substance becomes subject by way of passing into its predicates:
    * Capitalism is Evil, disruptive from the standpoint of the precapitalist corporate society because it is a case of a predicate (subordinated moment of the social totality -money-) which elevates itself into an End-in-itself.
        * Once it establishes itself as a system which posits its own presuppositions; the site of Evil is displaced and now the left-overs of the previous Good are Evil, they disturb the untroubled circulation of Capital.
    * The substance which at the end totalizes the derailed process is not the same as the substance disintegrated by the initial derailment.
        * What was at the outset the non-alienated substantial unity does not return t itself, it changes into a subordinated moment of a new totality that grew out of a partial aspect of the initial unity.
* Radicalizing the thesis that the possibility of Evil pertains to the notion of subjectivity: *the status of the subject as such is evil*. Insofar as we are human, we always-already have chosen Evil.
    * Lacan vs ego-psychology "maturity" as the ability to endure frustrations:
        * "The ego as such is frustration in its essence": the frustration generated from the side of the mirror-double is constitutive of the ego.
        * What first appears as an external hindrance frustrating the ego's striving is experienced as the ultimate support of its being.
        * *Pathology* is defined by the way the subject relates to norms: do they function as traumatic injunctions, are they repressed or fully acknowledged etc.
* Evil qua ethical attitude in the gaze of nostalgia (*How Green Was My Valley*)
    * The responsibility for the decline, the true source of Evil, is in the very point of view from which the story is told, the nostalgic view which is able to perceive as the source of Evil only the cruel impact of the external Fate.
* Kant: logic of "real opposition": Evil is not only the absence of Good, it is a positive contrary to Good.

Three degrees of Evil in Kant:
* Mildest: weakness of the human nature
    * I know what my duty, but not enough strength to follow its call.
    * Underlying gesture of self-objectivization: my natural dispositions determine by behavior only insofar as I qua free autonomous being acknowledge them, so I am fully responsible for them.
* Second form: the subject claims to act for the sake of duty whereas he is truly led by pathological motivations.
    * E.g. severe teacher who is actually sadistic.
    * Self deception is deeper than in the first case; subject misperceives the contours of duty.
    * Pathological motivation which misperceives itself as fulfilling one's duty by way of self-deceit.
* Worst: the subject perceives morality as simple external set of rules that society puts up in order to restrain the pursuit of egotistical pathological interests.
    * The notions of right and wrong lose their meaning
* Fourth, excluded form of *"diabolical Evil"*: Evil is not externally opposed to Good but becomes the content of Good's form.
    * The impetus of my activity is "nonpathological" and runs against my egotistical interests.
    * E.g. left-wing totalitarian regimes; they are not cases of disguising selfish interests under virtue's clothes.
        * Jacobinical "dictature of virtue"
    * Within the parameters of Kant's philosophy, it is indistinguishable from the Good.

### There Are Pipes and Pipes

Diabolical Evil, the 'unthought' of Kant, is unrepresentable as it entails the breakdown of the logic of representation.
* Madame Bovary, post-Kantian episteme of 19th century
    * The speech whose official function is to conceal sexuality actually engenders the appearance of its secret
    * The repressed content is an effect of repression; irrelevant and boring architectural details torment the reader, greedy to learn what happens in the space behind the closed curtains of the coach.
    * Any obscenity is constrained to the reader's imagination obsessed by the real thing behind the curtain.
* Cinema, hors-champ: the externality of the field of vision which, in its very absence, organizes the economy of what can be seen.
* Externality which has to remain excluded if the field of what can be represented is to retain its consistency.
* Realism: naive belief that some full substantial reality actually exists behind the curtain of representations.
    * Post-realism begins with a doubt as to the existence of this reality behind the curtain.
    * The gesture of concealment creates what it pretends to conceal.

René Magritte, post-realist playfulness:
* *La Lunette d'approche*: the frame of the windowpane is the fantasy-frame which constitutes reality, whereas through the crack we get an insight into the "impossible" Real, the Thing-in-itself.
* Matrix of Kantian split between symbolized (categorized, transcendentally constituted) reality and the void of the Thing-in-itself.
    * 1: presence of "extraneous" element in depicted reality
        * Has its place in it, although it does not "fit" in it.
        * Fantasy-object filling out the blackness of the real in *La Lunette d'approche.*
        * *Les Deux Mysteres: *emergence of the symbolic order splits reality into itself and the enigmatic surplus of the real, each one "derealizing" its counterpart.
            * Economy of desire; gap between the inaccessible object-cause of desire and the empirical pipe which is never "that".
    * 2: *Vorstellungs-Repraesentanz: *symbolic representative of an originally missing, excluded representation.
        * *Personnage marchant vers l'horizon*: Inverted rebus: words themselves fill out the void of the absent things.

### The Non-intersubjective Other

Uncanny apparitions of an Other who precedes the Other of "normal" intersubjectivity.
* *Vertigo*: Scottie's gaze between crack of door looking at Madeleine in the mirror
    * The crack of the half-open door makes room for the Thing.
    * If beyond appearance there is no thing in itself (no knowledge of the Thing in itself), there is the gaze.
* Subject and an Otherness which is prior to intersubjectivity: cinematic disposition where subject and the shadowy double stare into a common third point (materialized in the spectators).
    * Reference to the absent third point which attracts the two gazes changes the status of the one in the background into the sublime embodiment of the real of enjoyment.
    * Condensation of the field and counter-field within the same shot.
    * Paradoxical communication with the excrescence behind, mediated by a third gaze.
    * The subject is enthralled by the gaze which sees "what is in himself more than himself".
    * Analysis: the analyst sits behind the analysand, is the analysand's *objet petit a*, not his dialogical partner/another subject.

### The Object of the Indefinite Judgement

In Kant, the crack is opened by the distinction between negative and indefinite judgment.
* Positive: the soul is mortal
* Negative: the soul is not mortal (predicate is denied to the subject)
* Indefinite: The soul is not-mortal. (affirming a non-predicate)

Different modalities of opposition and/or negation:
* 1. Real opposition between two positive forces which cancel each other out.
    * "Real" as in feature constitutive of the notion of "reality": antagonism of a force and its counterforce (magnetism, attraction and repulsion etc.)
    * Opposite of a positive force is not nothing, the lack of this force, but another force possessing its own positive ontological actuality.
    * *nihil privativum*: outcome of the mutual "privation" of the two opposite force.
    * Presupposed common ground (field of magnetism)
* 2. Logical contradiction: *nihil negativum*: the notion of the object under consideration contradicts itself and thereby cancels itself.
    * E.g. "square circle",* Unding* ("non-thing"): empty object devoid of its notion.
* 3. Antinomy: objects which a priori cannot be intuited i.e. imagined as objects of our experience, not logically impossible.
    * Empty notions devoid of their intuited objects.
    * *Gedankending*, an object-of-thought.

Difference between contradiction and antinomy brings into play the transcendental dimension: the zero of antinomy is transcendental: the very problem is false since the common ground of the dispute (universe as a totality of phenomena, soul) does not exist as an object of our possible experience.

Gedankending: we are compelled to refer to such objects on account of the irreducible finitude of our experience.

Noumena are objects of indefinite-limiting judgment: "the Thing is non-phenomenal".
* Positive and negative meanings of "noumenon":
    * Positive: noumenon is an object of a nonsensible intuition
        * Expressed by the negative judgment: judgment delineates a domain beyond phenomena where it locates the Thing.
        * Transcendental illusion
    * Negative: noumenon is a thing insofar as it is not an object of our sensible intuition.
        * Expressed by the indefinite judgment: leaves in suspense the positive status of the thing, negative determination.
        * "Is not mortal" vs "is non-mortal": non-predicate affirmed.
* Transcendental illusion is misreading of infinite judgment as negative judgment.
* Hegel: limitation as prior to what lies "beyond" it.
    * The Suprasensible is "appearance qua appearance": Thing-in-itself is the limitation of the phenomena as such.

Repeating with the negation displaced onto the subject: "He is full of idiotic features without being an individual".
* Indefinite judgments, "living dead": vampires outside the domain of the dead but not locating them in the domain of the living.
    * Undead retains all  the predicates of a living being without being one.

### Ate and Its Beyond

Stories of the place of passage between reality and the fantasy's "other place";
* Moebius band
* Shakespeare; after series of tragedies (*Hamlet*, *King Lear*), we enter realm of fairy-tale harmony (*The Tempest*, *Cymbeline*).
* Greek, "ate", Antigone:
    * Age denotes both a horrifying limit which cannot ever be reached i.e. whose touch means death, and the space beyond it.
    * Primacy of the limit over the space; we don't have two spheres which are divided by a limit, we have reality and its limit, the void around which it is structured.
        * The fantasy-space is secondary, it changes the impossible into the prohibited.
        * Horror → bliss, impossible limit → forbidden place
        * Real → Symbolic
        * Real impossible cannot be reached not because of its inherent impossibility but because access to it is hindered by the external barrier of a prohibition.
            * *There is One* which is the prohibited object of incest (mother) and its prohibition renders accessible all other objects.
* National revival under colonial repression: it is the colonial repression ("prohibition") that stirs up resistance and renders possible the "national revival".
    * Hegel: illusion of external reflection overlooks the fact that national identity comes to be through the experience of the threat to its existence, it did not exist at all before this experience.
* Eluding the real qua impossible, inherent impossibility is replaced by a fairy beatitude.
    * Agents of the anticolonialist national-liberation struggle necessarily fall prey to the illusion that they "realize the ancient dreams of their oppressed ancestors.
        * Legitimizing the existing order by presenting as a realization of the dream of the Other, the dead ancestor's dream.
        * Any doubt about it is entailed with guilt, betraying the dream of subjects supposed to believe.
        * Detour through the dead Other is necessary for idealogical legitimization of the present to take effect.
* Irma's injection; three stages of the dream correspond to 
    * the imaginary dual-relationship, 
    * its aggravation into an unbearable antagonism which announces the encounter of the Real, and 
    * the final appeasement via the advent of the symbolic order.
* NOT symbolic bliss vs "hard reality"; what we call reality constitutes itself against the background of bliss, of an exclusion of some traumatic Real.
    * Fantasy is the ultimate support of reality; frame of symbolic bliss.

### The Symbolic Beatitude

Reversal of horror into symbolic bliss; Hegelian triad:
* Being → Nothing, nothing as the truth of being;
    * Being as subject, cannot attribute any predicate, Nothing functions as a positivization of this impasse.
* Logic of notional passage is that of a reflective positivization of a failure, of the impossibility of the passage itself.
    * One fails to determine the truth of X,  and this failure is the truth of X
* Lacanian triad *need-demand-desire*:
    * First,  mythical quasi-natural starting point of an immediate* need*, the point which is always-already presupposed, never posited, experienced as such.
    * Second, need is articulated in the symbolic medium, it always already is, and starts to function as *demand*; call to the Other, Mother qua primordial figure of the Other.
        * The demand's true aim is the love of the Other, who has the power to procure the object.
        * The demand sublates the particularity of everything that can be granted by transmuting it into a proof of love. Particular material object is sublated, annulled in its immediacy and posited as something "mediated"; a medium through which a dimension transcendent to its immediate reality (of love) finds its expression.
        * Antagonistic relationship between need and demand, experience of "This is not that!"
    * Desire = demand - need
        * Irreducible to need.
        * Reversal is a "negation of the negation" insofar as it entails a return to the object annulled by the the passage from need to demand: it produces a new object which replaces the lost-sublated object of need --- objet petit a.
        * Appeasement: desire resolves the antagonistic deadlock between need and demand.
            * Internalization of lack

Thesis-antithesis-synthesis:
* Imaginary starting point of complementary poles, followed by the outbreak of the real of their antagonism
    * Extreme tension is resolved by means of symbolization when the poles are united against the background of their common lack.
* The antithesis is what the thesis lacks in order to actualize its notional content.
* Thesis is in itself abstract; it presupposes its mediation by the antithesis.
* The first extreme, in its abstraction from the other, is this other itself. An extreme passes over into its other at the moment when it radically opposes itself to this other
    * Being reveals itself as Nothing at the moment we endeavor to grasp it in its pureness as radically opposed to Nothing.
* Politics: insofar as the universal Will is opposed to the multitude of particular Wills, it turns into the utmost particular Will of those who pretend to embody it.
* Each of the extremes is not only the negation of the other but a negation which refers to itself, its own negation.
* Synthesis conveys appeasement; in it, the imaginary opposition is symbolized, turned into a symbolic dyad.
    * The extremes are posited as elements of a signifying network; they are held together by the lack they have in common.
    * Symbolic exchange; any positive object which circulates among the terms is nothing but the embodiment of a lack.
    * Contradiction is resolved when we acknowledge the primacy of the difference; when we conceive identity as an effect of the tissue of differences.
    * *Compulsion to identify;* contradiction is non-identity under the aspect of identity; dialectical primacy of the principle of contradiction makes the thought of unity the measure of heterogeneity.

## 4 Hegel's "Logic of Essence" as a Theory of Ideology

### The Principle of the Insufficient Ground

A choice is an act which retroactively grounds its own reasons.
* Gap between S2 (causal chain of reasons provided by reason) and S1 (decision which concludes the chain)
    * Foundation of transferential relationship epitomized by love.
    * *Unary feature* which triggers love is always an index of an imperfection.
* *Positing of presupposition*: we are determined only by reasons which we retroactively recognize as such.
    * Kant, "Incorporation Thesis", element of spontaneity which pertains to the subject, making him irreducible to a link in the causal chain
    * Spontaneity is moment of reflexivity: the determination of the subject by the other is always the subject's self-determination.
    * A decision is simultaneously dependent on and independent of its conditions: it "independently" posits its own dependence.
    * The subject in German Idealism is always the subject of self-consciousness.
    * Spontaneous ideological narrativization of our experience and activity.
        * Narratives are retroactive reconstructions for which we are responsible, we cannot refer to them as a found condition, context, or presupposition of our activity.
    * Positing the presuppositions is ultimately contingent.

Self-consciousness is another name for desire being by definition the "desire of a desire": the subject implicitly answers the question "which of your desires do you desire (have you chosen) by way of actual desiring."
* Self-consciousness is founded upon the non-transparency of the subject to itself.
    * Kantian transcendental apperception (self-consciousness of pure I) is possible only insofar as I am unattainable to myself in my noumenal dimension qua "Thing which thinks."

Circular positing of the presuppositions reaches a deadlock, solved by the logic of non-all: although for every particular presupposition, it can be demonstrated that it is posited, naturalized, it would be wrong to reach universal conclusion that everything presupposed is posited.
* Presupposed X which is resistant to retroactive positing is the *Real*.
* Cultural overdetermination of the dividing line between gender and sex does NOT mean that sex is the effect of "sexuality" (heterogeneous texture of discursive practices)
    * What gets lost is the Real.
    * Nature qua Real remains the unfathomable X which resists cultural gentrification.
* Real is the gap preventing us to complete the gesture of universalization.
    * Every demarcation between the Symbolic and the Real, every exclusion of the Real qua prohibited-inviolable, is a symbolic part: inversion of impossibility into prohibition-exclusion occults the inherent deadlock of the Real.
    * One can touch the real only by applying oneself to its symbolization, up to the very failure of this endeavor.
    * The real can be discerned only by way of the deadlocks of its formalization: the status of the Real is non-substantial, it is a product of failed attempts to integrate it into the Symbolic.
* Impasse of presupposing: an entity can easily be reduced to the totality of its presuppositions. What is missing from the series of presuppositions is the performative act of formal conversion which retroactively posits these presuppositions, making them into the presuppositions of ...
    * Tautological gesture of the Master-Signifier which constitutes the entity in question as One.
* Asymmetry between positing and presupposing:
    * Positing of presuppositions reaches its limit in the "feminine" non-all and what eludes it is the Real.
        * Positing reflection
    * Enumerations of the presuppositions of the posited content is made into a closed series by means of the "masculine" performative.
        * External reflection
* Logic of essence: identity, difference, contradiction; essence/form, form/matter, content/form; formal, real, complete ground.

### Identity, Difference, Contradiction

Identity in Hegel is NOT simple self-equality of any notional determination but the identity of an essence which "stays the same" beyond the flow of appearances.
* Identity as a determination-of-reflection.
* Identity hinges upon what makes a difference: identity of an entity consists of the cluster of its differential features.
    * Identity → difference
* Difference → contradiction: contradiction designates the antagonistic relationship between what I am "for the others" -my symbolic determination- and what I am "in myself".
    * Contradiction between $ and S1: my "alienation" in the symbolic mandate, in S1, retroactively makes $ - the void which eludes the hold of the mandate- out of my brute reality.
    * I am nothing outside of my relations to the others, but this nothing is the nothing of pure self-relating: I am the one who self-determines myself, i.e. who determines which network of relations to others will determine me.
        * Spontaneity qua self-determination: in my very relating to the other I relate myself to myself, since I determine the concrete form of my relating to the other.
    * Man and woman: we arrive at contradiction only when "man" appears as the immediate embodiment of the universal human dimension and woman as "truncated man".
    * Opposition → contradiction: *oppositional determination*, when the universal common ground of the two opposites "encounters" itself in its oppositional determination, i.e. in one of the terms of the opposition.
        * Capital: the multitude of capitals necessarily contains "finance capital", immediate embodiment of capital in general as opposed to particular capitals.
            * Contradiction between capital in general and the species of capital which embodies capital in general.
    * Contradiction between the position of enunciation and the enunciated content.

### Form/Essence, Form/Matter, Form/Content

Hegel: Essence in its immediacy is the immediate inwardness, essence which persists irrespective of the external form.
* Form/Essence: Essence as empty determination whose adequacy can be tested only by verifying the extent to which it is expressed in the external form.
* Form/Matter: form is no longer passive expression-effect, but the agent which individuates the otherwise passive-formless matter, conferring on it some particular determination.
    * Essence, conceived abstractedly from its form, changes into matter.
    * "Matter" is the passive moment of subsistence, whereas "form" is what provides for its specific determination, what makes this thing what it is.
* Inherent contradiction of the notion of form which designates both the principle of universalization and the principle of individuation.
    * Matter is NOT passive-formless, it already in itself possesses an inherent structure, something which stands opposite form furnished with its own content.
    * Content/form is another name for the tautological relationship by which form is related to itself.
        * "Content" is formed matter: "form" as the way some content is actualized in matter (by means of matter's adequate formation". The same "content" can be told in different forms.
        * Also, form as the universality which unites the multitude of diverse contents (e.g. form of the classical detective novel).
    * "Content" is the way matter is mediated by form and inversely, "form" is the way content finds its expression in matter.
        * The relationship is tautological; "content" is form itself in its *oppositional determination*.

### Formal, Real, Complete Ground

Formal ground repeats the tautological gesture of the immediate reference to "true essence": does not add any new content to the phenomenon, only transposes the found empirical content into the form of ground.
* Necessary constitutive function of converting the contingent content, renders possible the search for the real ground.
* Formal causality qua empty gesture opens up the field of the analysis of content.
* Tautological explanations fill out the empty form of ground with some fantasized, imaginary content.
    * E.g. "magnetism", natural forces in which empty determinations-of-thought assume the form of positive determinate content.

Real ground:
* Difference between ground and grounded ceases to be purely formal, is displaced into content itself and conceived as the distinction between two of its constituents.
* Isolating some moment, conceiving it as the "ground" of all other moments which thereby appear as what is "grounded".
    * Why this moment and not some other?
        * Detailed analysis of the entire network of relations which explains why it is precisely this element of the network which plays the role of ground.

Complete ground: the real ground's relationship to the remaining content is again grounded in ITSELF, i.e. in the totality of its relations to the grounded.
* The ground grounds the grounded, but this grounding role must be itself grounded in the relationship of the ground to the grounded.
* New tautology contains the moment of contradiction, it designates the identity of the Whole with its oppositional determination, identity of a moment of the Whole -real ground- with the Whole itself.

Althusser, **overdetermination**: the very determining instance is overdetermined by the total network of relations within which it plays the determining role.
* Expressive-transitive-overdeterminate causality; Lacanian triad of Imaginary-Real-Symbolic:
    * *Expressive causality - Imaginary*: identical imago which leaves its imprint at different levels of material content.
    * *Overdetermination - Symbolic totality*: retroactive determination of the ground by the totality of the grounded is possible only within a symbolic universe.
    * *Transitive causality - senseless collisions of the Real*.
* Element of subjectivity which cannot be reduced to imaginary misrecognition qua effect of interpellation is missing in Althusser.
    * $, "empty" barred subject.

### From "In-itself" to "For-itself"

Fundamental antagonism of the entire logic of essence is the antagonism between ground and conditions, between the inner essence ("true nature") of a thing and the external circumstances which render possible the realization of this essence.
* Impossibility of reaching a common measure between these two dimensions, of coordinating them in a "higher-order synthesis".
* Alternative between positing and external reflection: 
    * there is no way of drawing a line between the two aspects: every inner potential can be translated into an external condition and vice versa.

Anti-evolutionary Hegel: **in-itself/for-itself**
* In-itself (vs for-itself)
    * What exists only potentially, contrary to the actuality
    * Actuality itself in the sense of external, immediate objectivity which is opposed to subjective mediation which is not yet internalized.
    * In-itself is actuality insofar as it has not yet reached its Notion.
* The potentiality of the object must be also present in its external actuality, under the form of heteronomous coercion.
    * In-itself = for us; for some consciousness external to the thing-in-itself.
* Positing reflection observes things as they are in their eternal essence, whereas external reflection observes them in their dependence on a series of contingent external circumstances.


How does Hegel overcome "external reflection"?
* Lacan: "passivity" of the analyst, all he has to do is clear the way for the analysand to arrive at his own truth.
    * *Cunning of reason*, letting the subject freely deploy its potentials.
* Kant's critique of the ontological proof of God's existence vs Hegel's reaffirmation is NOT return to domain of classical metaphysics:
    * Kant:
        * Hidden if-clause at work in the ontological proof; if God exists, he exists necessarily.
        * Existence is contingent, designates phenomenal reality of the objects of possible experience but the difference between Reason and Intuition is constitutive of reality; one has to add the passive contingent element of intuition.
            * Notion of "necessary existence" is self-contradictory since every existence is by definition contingent.
    * Hegel: how does the coming-to-notion affect the existence of the object in question?
        * Historical materialism; knowledge is self-referential, changes its object. The object becomes what it truly is via the act of knowledge. The rise of "class consciousness" produces the effect in existence of its object by way of changing it into an actual revolutionary subject.
        * Psychoanalysis: the interpretation of a symptom constitutes a direct intervention of the Symbolic in the Real, the word can affect the Real of the symptom.
            * Presupposing entities whose existence hinges on a non-knowledge; the moment knowledge is assumed, existence disintegrates.
        * Existence designates the way the Thing is related to itself through the detour of its predicates-properties.
* In-itself → for-itself; failed encounter, the passage to "for itself", to the Notion, involves the loss of existence.

### Ground versus Conditions

Commonplace ground and conditions: racism as latent psychic disposition, racist disposition is the "ground" and the current political struggles are the conditions of its effectuation.
* What counts as ground and what counts as conditions is ultimately contingent and exchangeable.
    * E.g. Marxist reversal; present political struggle as the only true determining ground.
    * Latent dispositions brought forth by the recent political struggle qua its determining ground

Renaissance: Tautological gesture is the way out of the impasse of vicious circle of ground and conditions: the new zeitgeist had to constitute itself by presupposing itself in its exteriority, in its external conditions.
* The return to external conditions had to coincide with the return to the foundation, to the "thing itself", to the ground.
* Empty gesture retroactively ascertaining that the thing in question is already present in its conditions is the definition of the* symbolic act*.

### The Tautological "Return of the Thing to Itself"

Gesture of the "return of the thing to itself": one must include along with the definition of the object its name.
* The name makes out of the positive properties and ingredients a unique, self-identical thing.
* The supplementary operation posits external conditions as the conditions/components of the thing and presupposes the existence of ground which holds together the multitude of conditions.
* Lacan:* point de capiton* at which the signifier falls into the signified.
    * E.g. shark in Jaws:
        * Reifying the multitude of fears the common man is dominated by.
        * The sharks is both more than a symbol (it becomes the feared "thing itself") and less than a symbol (it does not point toward the symbolized social content but renders it invisible.
    * E.g. "Jew"
        * Does not add any new content, the entire content is already present in the external conditions (crisis, moral degeneration..)
        * The name accomplishes transubstantiation, changing the elements into many manifestations of the same ground, the "Jewish plot".
        * The transcendental object of Jewishness is the X which "makes a Jew into a Jew" and for which we look in vain among his positive properties.
            * Appearance of an objectal surplus.
* Contingency and necessity:
    * Passage to necessity accomplished by the gesture of adding a name which confers upon the contingent series the mark of necessity.
* Necessity → freedom:
    * NOT "freedom as comprehended necessity)
    * It is only the subject's free act of "dotting the I" which retroactively installs necessity; the very act by which the subject recognizes and constitutes necessity is the supreme act of freedom and as such the self-suppression of necessity.
* The act of naming is "performative" only and precisely insofar as it is always-already part of the definition of the signified content.
* Tautological return-upon-itself of the thing in its very external presuppositions is the resolution of the deadlock of positing and external reflection
    * Kant: they synthesis of multitude of sensations implies empty surplus, the positing of an X as the unknown substratum of the perceived phenomenal sensations.
        * Transcendental object is the opposite of Ding-an-sich: it is empty insofar as it is devoid of any "objective" content.
        * The empty X which remains after evacuating sensible content from the object is the pure objective correlate/effect of the subject's autonomous-synthetic activity.
        * Transcendental object is the "in-itself" insofar as it is for the subject, posited by it; it is pure "positedness" of an indeterminate X.
        * Constitutive/regulative principles;
            * Generally, constitutive principles serve to construct reality while regulative principles are subjective maxims which guide reason.
        * Dynamical regulative principles vs mathematical constitutive:
            * Mathematical use of categories refer to the intuited phenomenal content, dynamical principles of synthesis guarantee that the content of our representations refer to some objective existence.
                * Objective existence dependent on regulative principles?

### The "Absolute Unrest of Becoming"

Hegel undermines the common supposition of the external relationship of being and knowledge.
* Speculative idealism: the process of knowledge is not something external to the object but inherently determines its status.
    * Kant: the conditions of possibility of experience are also the conditions of possibility of the objects of experience.
* Contingency does express the incompleteness of our knowledge, but this incompleteness also ontologically defines the object of knowledge itself, bears witness to the fact that the object itself is not yet ontologically "realized", fully actual.
    * Behind the appearance of contingency there is no hidden, not-yet-known necessity, but only the necessity of the very appearance that, behind superficial contingency, there is an underlying substantial necessity.
* External → absolute reflection:
    * External: appearance is the elusive surface concealing its hidden necessity.
    * Absolute: appearance is the appearance of this unknown Necessity behind contingency.
* If contingency is an appearance concealing some hidden necessity, then this necessity is an appearance of itself.

Relationship of between possibility (qua subjective seizing of actuality) and actuality (qua the object of conceptual seizing):
* Contingency designates the dialectical unity in the mode of subjectivity, of the "absolute unrest" of becoming, of the split between subject and object.
* Necessity designates it in the mode of objectivity, of determinate being, of the identity of subject and object, of the Result.

Objet a, pure semblance, is a kind of "anticipation" of being from the perspective of becoming.
* Matter as correlative to incomplete form, "mere form", anticipation of itself qua complete form.
* Spatially, a is an object which is indiscernible to the straightforward look.
* Temporally, it is an object which exits only qua anticipated or lost, never in the "now' of a pure undivided present.
* Transcendental object gives body to the inequality of form to itself, not an index of the surplus of the material in-itself over form.

### Actuality of the Possible

Possibility itself, in its opposition to actuality, possesses an actuality of its own.
* Actuality is presupposed as something given.
    * Leibnizean speculation of multitude of possible worlds always takes place against the background of the hard fact of actual existence.
* Actuality is marked by an indelible brand of the (real as) "impossible and the shift to possibility, the suspension of actuality through inquiry into its possibility is an endeavor to avoid the trauma of the real, endeavor to integrate the real by means of conceiving it as something that is meaningful within our symbolic universe.
    * "Contingency" designates an actual content insofar as it cannot be wholly grounded in its conceptual conditions of possibility.
* Inherent antagonism that pertains to the notion of possibility: 
    * possibility designates both empty possibility and "possible" in the sense of being able to actualize itself.
        * True nature of a possibility it confirmed only by way of its actualization; the only effective proof that you really can do something is simply to do it.
    * Possibility of acting differently exerts pressure on us in the guise of "voice of conscience".
        * Superego, 

Hegel: possibility is simultaneously less and more than what its notion implies;
    * Conceived in its abstract opposition to actuality, it is "mere possibility", coincides with impossibility.
    * Possesses actuality in its capacity of possibility.
        * The idea of freedom realizes itself through a series of failure; from its point of view, freedom remains an empty possibility but the striving of freedom to realize itself bears witness to its "actuality".

Possibility as such exerts actual effects which disappear as soon as it "actualizes" itself.
* Symbolic castration; castration anxiety designates the moment at which the possibility of castration takes precedence over its actuality. The possibility of castration produces actual effects.
* Power; it is actually exerted only in the guise of a potential threat.
    * *Paternal authority*; a father losing control and displaying his full power is an impotent rage, index of the opposite of authority.
    * Lord and Bondsman; the mere possibility of victory is sufficient.
    * The surplus of what is "in the possibility more than a mere possibility" and which gets lost in its actualization is the real qua impossible.
    * Master is always an impostor i.e. somebody who illegitimately occupies the place of the lack in the symbolic Order.
        * Metonymy of death, his consistency hinges upon the deferral of a force that fe falsely claims to possess.
* Difference between the phallic signifier and the fetish:
    * Fetish fills out the void of the missing maternal phallus.
        * Always claims an actual status, it pretends actually to substitute for the maternal phallus.
    * The phallus is the signifier of the very lack of the signifier.
        * Never fully actualized, it is the empty signifier which stands for the potentiality of any possible future meaning.
        * It is a fetish of itself: phallus qua "signifier of castration" gives body to its own lack.

# III SUM The Loop of Enjoyment

## 5 "The Wound Is Healed Only by the Spear That Smote You"

The end of classical subjectivity is the point of emergence of the modern hysterical subject.

* History of opera is the prehistory of psychoanalysis
* Schoenberg: feminine hysteria not possible to articulate in the classical tonal aria.
    * *Erwartung*

### The Answer of the Real

Intersubjective constellation at the origins of opera: voice of the subject beseeching the Master (King, divinity) to suspend his own Law for a brief moment.
* Ambiguity between power and impotence in the gesture of grace by means of which the Master answers the subject's entreaty.
    * Grace expresses supreme power, the power to rise above one's own law.
        * Symbolic exchange between the human subject and his divine Master: the Master respond's to subject's offer of self-sacrifice with gesture of Grace, the ultimate proof of the Master's humanity.
        * BUT, forced empty gesture: Master is compelled to make gesture of Grace, otherwise the subject's entreaty might turn into open rebellion.

Monteverdi → Gluck, Descartes → Kant:
* Monteverdi, sublimation: Orpheus is consoled by the Divine after losing Eurydice.
    * Death-drive and creative sublimation: Orpheus's gaze is a perverse act: he loses her intentionally in order to regain her as the object of sublime poetic inspiration.
* Gluck provided new form of subjectivization: intervention of Grace is not answer to subject's entreaty but an answer in the moment when the subject decides to put his life at stake.

Mozart is already present in Gluck, the assertion of subject's autonomy (readiness to die, to lose all) gives rise to a gesture of mercy in the Other.
* Don Giovanni is negation: he refuses to repent and is swallowed by the flames of Hell.
    * Radical Evil: autonomy which doesn't leave any space open for mercy.

Autonomy itself, in its self-affirmation, relies on "mercy", on a sign of the Other, on an "answer of the real".
* "Help yourself and God will help you": the subject prepares the ground in advance so that all that is left for the God-Master is to nod his assent after the fact.
* The other intervenes at the moment of a gesture of defiant renunciation and disavowal of instrumental reason by the subject.
    * Grace is a state which is essentially a by-product.
    * E.g. Abraham's acceptance of God's command to sacrifice his son: because he accepted it, he did not have to carry it out.
* Democracy, elections, confidence in the answer of the real.

Modern-age subjectivity struggled to articulate the paradoxical conjunction of autonomy and Grace.

### Subjectivity and Grace

**"Cunning of reason"**: the "answer of the Real" on which we rely, the support in the big Other whose gesture of response "subjectivizes" the abyss of the pure subject.
* Readiness to "sacrifice everything" is the return of consciousness into the depths of the  I=I, loss of substance and its standing over and against consciousness.
* The sacrifice isn't feigned, what dies in the experience of the return into the night of the I=I is Substance itself i.e. God qua transcendent agency which pulls the strings behind the stage.
    * "Death of God" = the subject finds himself alone, without any guarantee in substantial Reason, in the big Other.

Openness of risk is followed automatically by the reversal into mercy:
* Formal conversion: the intervention of Grace is not distinct from the preceding loss, but IS this very loss, act of self-renunciation, conceived from a different perspective.
    * Death of Christ is simultaneously a day of grief and a day of joy; instead of the substance qua God-Master, we obtain the substance qua community of believers.
* The wound is healed only by the spear that smote you: the death of God IS his resurrection, the weapon that killed Christ IS the tool that created the Christian community of the Holy Spirit.

Loop of subjectivity, economical paradox:
* Lacan: castration means that the Thing-jouissance most be lost in order to be regained on the ladder of desire, symbolic order recovers its own constitutive debt.
* Hegel: the immediate identity of the substance must be lost in order to be regained through the work of subjective mediation.
* "Subject" is the name for the economic paradox whereby the conditions of possibility coincide with the conditions of impossibility.
* Kant: the I of transcendental apperception can be said to be "self-conscious", can experience itself as a free spontaneous agent to the very extent to which it is inaccessible to itself as the "Thing which thinks"
    * Ethics: the subject of practical reason can act morally to the extent to which any direct access to Supreme Good is barred to him.

"Subjectivization" (assuming imposed symbolic mandate) is a kind of defense mechanism against an abyss which "is" the subject.
* Althusserian closing of the circle, misrecognition in interpellation, is not the direct effect of a "process without subject" but an attempt to heal the wound of subjectivity.


Antagonism between subject and subjectivity in Kant's critiques:
* Pure reason: $, empty "I think" necessarily lapses into the transcendental Schein, mistaking itself for a "thinking substance", assuming that it has access to itself qua Thing-in-itself.
    * Splitting between $ and substantial "person"
    * Subjectivization: I recognize myself as "person" in the fullness of its content.
* Practical reason: the moral subject constituted by the universal form of categorical imperative necessarily falls prey to the Schein of Supreme Good, elevating some "pathological" content into the aim and impetus of its moral activity.
    * Splitting between duty for the sake of duty and serving some Supreme Good
    * Subjectivization: committing myself to some substantial Supreme Good
* Judgment: reflecting subject necessarily misses the purely regulative nature of a teleological judgment and misreads teleology as something that pertains to reality itself as its constitutive determination.
    * Splitting between sublime experience of the gap between phenomena/Idea and the "gentrification" of this gap via beauty and teleology.
* The lapse into teleology/substantial Supreme Good is an endeavor to heal the wound of the subject qua $, to fill in the gap which renders the Thing inaccessible. The lapse reinstates the subject into the "great chain of being".
* Kant opens up the space (possibility, need) for a thing and makes this thing inaccessible/impossible to accomplish by the same gesture.
    * Necessary and impossible entity is Lacanian Real

Hegel: if positing and prohibiting coincide absolutely, then there is no Thing-in-itself, the mirage of In-itself is created by the act of prohibiting.

Lacan, object cause of desire: desire becomes "pure" the moment it ceases to be conceived as the desire for a positively given object and it is posited as the desire for an object whose emergence coincides with its withdrawal i.e. which is nothing but the trace of its own retreat.
* Kantian "pure desire" is confined to the paradox of the subject's finitude.


### From Mozart to Wagner

Beethoven's Fidelio has both Mozart's fundamental matrix (of the intervention of Mercy which follows the gesture of self-sacrificing subjectivization) as well as Wagner's fundamental matrix of man's redemption through woman's willing self-sacrifice.

Stained man and woman in Wagner:
* Man is no longer innocent hero but suffering sinner, he is condemned to the domain between the two deaths.
* Woman, the hero's redeemer, acquires the features of hysteria so that we obtain a redoubled, mirrored fantasy.
    * Figure of woman ready to sacrifice herself is an ostentatious male phantasmagoria of Wagner himself.

Entreaties of men in Wagner: the hero bemoans his inability to find peace in death.

*Parsifal*:
 * S1: King Amfortas
 * S2: Magician Klingsor as the semblance of knowledge
 * $: Kundry, split hysterical woman
 * Objet a: Parsifal, Kundry's object-cause of desire yet totally insensitive to feminine charms.
* Lack of any proper action, only negative or empty symbolic gestures:
    * The opera limits itself to the opposition between the act of renunciation and the empty symbolic gesture.
        * Parsifal's repetition by identifying with Amfortas's suffering is rejection of Kundry's advances
        * Parsifal's assuming of the symbolic mandate of the king is act qua performative.

### "I Am Going to Talk to You about the Lamella..."

Boothby, *Death and Desire*:

* Imaginary vs Real axis: the alienation in the mirror stage interrupts life-flow and introduces an irreducible gap separating the imaginary ego from the polymorphous bodily drives, real Id.
    * Symbolic is of a secondary nature with regard to the original tension between the Imaginary and the Real.
    * Symbolization is the subject's endeavor to bring the Real of bodily drives excluded by imaginary identification to the light of the day by way of symbolic representatives.
        * Compromise-formation
* Death drive is the emergence of what was ostracized in imaginary identification, return of the polymorphous impulses is experienced as mortal threat since it entails the dissolution of its imaginary identity.
    * The foreclosed Real returns either in the form of non-symbolized raging or in the form of symbolic mediation, "sublated" in the symbolic medium.
    * Death-drive as a return of the life-force: life itself rebels against the ego, the true representative of death is ego itself as the petrified *imago* which interrupts the flow of life.
* Between two deaths: first death is the death of the ego and the second designates the interruption of the pre-symbolic life-flow itself.
    * Lacan's theory is reduced to the opposition between an original polymorphous life-force and its later coagulation to the Procrustian bed of imagos.
* BUT: the symbolic order "stands for death" in mortifying the real of the body and perturbing its "natural" instinctual rhythm thereby producing *the surplus of desire, desire AS surplus*: the mortifying symbolic machine produces the immortal desire, the Real of "pure life" which eludes symbolization.
* *Tristan und Isolde*:
    * Boothby: after drinking the philtre, Tristan and Isolde find themselves in the domain "between the two deaths", alive yet delivered of all symbolic ties.
        * The magical effect of the philtre is simply to suspend the "big Other", the symbolic reality of social obligations.
    * BUT: the pure life beyond death is the product of symbolization, so that symbolization itself engenders the surplus which escapes it.
        * The Symbolic itself opens up the wound it professes to heal.

Lacan in the 60s: death drive is the indestructible life sprouting in the domain between the two deaths that emerges as the ultimate object of horror.

* Lamella as libido: organ whose characteristic is not to exist but which is nevertheless an organ.
* Libido is what is subtracted from the living being by virtue of the fact that it is subject to the cycle of sexed reproduction.
* The *objets a* are its representatives, its figures.
    * E.g. breast
* Otherness prior to intersubjectivity: $ * a is the subject's impossible relationship to the amoeba-like creature.

### The Wagnerian Performative

Parsifal* is same blissful point of exception as Mozart's *Magic Flute*. Difference from other Wagner operas:

* In Parsifal, the king is delivered by a pure fool and not by the woman
* Wagner leaves out the Question Test, compulsive-neurotic ritual:
    * Freud's analysis of married woman, the woman wanted to prove to the Other's gaze that the stain is there, ther aim was to attract the Other's gaze to a certain stain, little fragment of the real which proves the husband's sexual potency. The aim of the symptom was to protect the husband's impotence.
    * Compulsive displaying of the bleeding lance in the traditional myth is proof of King's potency
    * *Lohengrin*: theme of forbidden question, paradox of self-destructive female curiosity.
        * Forced choice attesting to the dimension of *castration*: man is divided into the weak everyday fellow with whom a sexual relation is possible and the bearer of the symbolic mandate, the public hero.
            * Batman, Superman, hero in *Lohengrin.*
        * *Wagnerian performative*: the performative gesture by means of which the hero openly assumes his symbolic mandate, revealing his symbolic identity, proves incompatible with the very being of woman.
* Parsifal: fateful consequences of a failure to ask the required question.

### Beyond the Phallus

Question Test: the bodily wound -symptom- can be healed by being put into words i.e. the symbolic order can produce an effect upon the real.

* Symptom as an answer without its question, bereft of its proper symbolic context.
* Question can only be asked from the ignorant big Other, Parsifal is ignorant and neutral.

Second act in Wagner is step into "hystericization" which confers on the action the "modern" touch.
* Three acts of Parsifal, logical time:
    * First act, "instant of looking"
    * Second act "time for understanding"
    * Third act "moment for concluding"
* Change in the status of the big Other: Wagner's Parsifal is not a stand-in for the big Other.
* The status of symptom:
    * NOT as ciphered message which would disintegrate after its successful signification.
    * Particular signifying formation which confers on the subject its ontological consistency, enabling it to structure its basic constitutive relationship toward jouissance.
        * If the symptom is dissolved, the subject loses the ground under his feet.
        * "Woman is a symptom of man" = Man himself exists only through woman qua his symptom
            * Man ex-sists: his entire being lies in woman.
            * Woman insists, something remains outside the reference to the phallic enjoyment.
                * "Non-all" feminine jouissance
                * Woman redeems man by renouncing phallic enjoyment
* Wagner couldn't confront the "feminization" of Parsifal after he enters the domain "beyond the phallus", so his Parsifal falls into perversion.
    * Parsifal's identification with Amfortas' suffering is founded on the identification with the real of his suffering.
* Syberberg's female Parsifal in Act III subverts the ideology of "femininity as masquerade" according to which man is "man as such", the embodiment of the human genus. It is instead the phallic predicate whose status is that of a semblance.

### Safe-Keeping God's Jouissance

Subjectivization in Parsifal is perverse; equals self-objectivization, conceiving oneself as an instrument of the jouissance of the big Other.
* Wagner was against the idea of a formal, empty Law i.e. Jewish prohibition to fill out God's Name with a positive content.
    * Jewish prohibition same as democracy (empty locus of power)
* The idea of the Grail as the vessel containing the blood of Christ:
    * Blood is the "little piece of the real" which immediately legitimizes power, "naturally" belongs to and defines the locus of power.
    * Blood of Christ designates the surplus of the divine jouissance, the part of it which was not evacuated from the domain of the big Other.
    * "Redemption of the redeemer": Wagner's Christ does not have to die in order to redeem us, the source of redemption is the part of Christ which remained alive and did not expire on the Cross.
* The Wagnerian hero tends toward "second death", denial of the indestructible libido.
* Amfortas' replacement by Parsifal is the replacement of the traditional patriarchal authority by the totalitarian object-instrument of the Other's jouissance, the safekeeper of God's Enjoyment.

Parsifal's new authority vs traditional authority in relation to the big Other of the Law:
* Traditional authority: the Other is at the same time the Other of the Other: the authority which is capable of suspending its own Law in the act of Mercy.
* Wagner: "the wound can be healed" only by a free act which comes from the outside, is not engendered by the symbolic system itself.
    * After the subject takes upon himself the symbolic gesture, he loses "actual" power: all that is left to the subject is the empty, formal act of assent, tautological performative whereby he appoints himself the "spokesman of mute domination".

### The Perverse Loop

Perversion vs self-legitimization:
* Self-legitimization: the dead are our redeemers, and by dedicating ourselves to continuing their work we redeem the redeemers.
* Perversion: a person who intentionally mutilates the woman so that he can then continue to love her, thereby providing the sublime nature of his love.
    * Closed loop
    * Kant, *Critique of Practical Reason*
        * God had to create man as a truncated, split being for the ultimate goal of the creation, morality.
        * The "wound" (inaccessibility of the Thing) is "healed" (teleological Schein); the inaccessibility of the Thing is a positive condition of our freedom and moral dignity.
    * Wagner: the perverse subject willingly assumes the "dealing of the wound," accomplishing the crime which paves the way for the Good.

The role of *objet petit a* in the drive vs in desire:,
* The essential feature of the scopic drive is "making oneself seen"
    * NOT narcissistic "looking at oneself through the other", which lacks radically heterogeneous object qua gaze to which I expose myself in "making oneself seen".
* Desire: the subject assumes the inquisitive attitude of a voyeur, looking for the fascinating X, for some trace of what is hidden "behind the curtain"
* Drive: we make ourselves seen to the stain in the picture, to the impervious foreign body in the frame.

## 6 Enjoy Your Nation as Yourself!

Disintegration of Communism, the Western gaze is fascinated by the reinvention of Democracy.
* Eastern Europe functions for the West as its Ego-Ideal: the point from which West sees itself in a likeable, idealized form, as worthy of love.
    * The real object of fascination for the West is the gaze.

### The "Theft of Enjoyment"

Beyond symbolic identification, a community is held together by a shared relationship toward a Thing, toward Enjoyment incarnated.
* 	National identification is sustained by a relationship toward the Nation qua Thing.
* "Our Thing": something only accessible to us, yet constantly menaced by "them".
* The Thing is present in the elusive "our way of life".
    * Can have leftist connotation": the details that characterize the "way of life" of the working class.
    * Not reducible to a collection of features, the Thing is *present* in these features, *appears* through them.
* The belief in our Thing has reflexive structure proper to the intersubjective space: "I believe in the (national) Thing" = "I believe that others (members of my community) believe in the Thing".
    * The tautological character of the Thing -semantic void- is founded in this reflexive gesture.
    * The whole meaning of the Thing turns on the fact that "it means something" to people.
* The Thing is a Cause produced by its effects (the practices it animates).
* The pure discursive effect does not have enough "substance" to compel the attraction proper to a Cause, "substance" which must be added is enjoyment: a nation exists only as long as its specific enjoyment continues to be materialized in a set of social practices and transmitted through national myths that structure them.
* Nationalism: privileged domain of the eruption of enjoyment into the social field.
    * The "other" wants to steal our enjoyment and/or has access to some secret perverse enjoyment.
    * What really bothers us about the "other" is the peculiar way he organizes his enjoyment, the surplus/excess that pertains to this way.
    * The Other as who essentially steals my own enjoyment.
        * Matheme of castration
* Unsolvable problem: the Other is the Other in my interior, there is no other enjoyment but my own. If the Other is in me, occupying the place of extimacy, then the hatred is also my own.
        * Enjoyment constitutes itself as "stolen", it "only comes to be through being left behind."


### Capitalism without Capitalism

What sets in motion the logic of "theft of enjoyment" is not immediate social reality but the inner antagonism inherent in the communities.

NOT simple transposition, ideological displacement, of the effective socioeconomic antagonisms of today's capitalism; it is through the displacement that desire is constituted.
* Enjoyment is ultimately always enjoyment of the Other: the fantasies about the Other's special, excessive enjoyment are ways for us to organize our own enjoyment.
* The Other's enjoyment exerts powerful fascination because in it we represent to ourselves our own innermost relationship toward enjoyment.
    * The fascinating image of the Other gives body to our own innermost split and prevents us from achieving full identity with ourselves. 
    * The hatred of the Other is the hatred of our own excess of enjoyment.

The national Thing functions as a "particular Absolute" resisting universalization, bestowing special "tonality" upon every neutral universal notion.

Spontaneous presupposition of democratic desire as what is "repressed" in Eastern Europe. But what the West gets instead is constructions of thieves of enjoyment.
* Eastern Europe is returning to the West the "repressed" truth of its democratic desire.
* Powerless fascination of the critical leftist intellectuals; they are trying to maintain a distance from national enjoyment but this distance is a disavowal of the fact that their desire is already implied, caught in the Cause.
* Obsessive adherence to the national Cause is what remains the same throughout the process: the Real which "always returns to its place".
    * It was already the Communist power that produced the compulsive attachment to the national Cause.
    * The ethnic Cause is the left-over that persists once the Communist ideological fabric disintegrates.
        * Once we overthrow the Communist symbolic form, what we get is the underlying relation to the ethnic Cause, stripped of this form.

Why does the attachment to the ethnic Cause persist even after the power structure that produced it (Communist bureaucracies) has collapsed?
* The elementary feature of capitalism consists of its inherent structural imbalance: its normal state is the permanent production of an excess.
* Vicious circle of capitalism: producing more than any other socioeconomic formation to satisfy human needs, capitalism produces even more needs to be satisfied.
    * Lacan: capitalism is the reign of the discourse of the hysteric.
* Capitalism and superego: superego also concerns structural imbalance; the more we obey its command, the more we feel guilty, renunciation entails only a demand for more renunciation.
    * Capitalism, increase in production to fill out the lack only widens the lack.
    * Discourse of the *Master*: the Master's role is to balance, to regulate the excess. With capitalism, this function of the Master becomes suspended.
        * Foucault: ancient Master embodied the ethics of self-mastery and "just measure".
* Corporatism is the necessary reverse of capitalism.
    * Fascist dream is to have capitalism without its "excess", without the antagonism that causes its structural imbalance.
        * Return of the figure of the Master who guarantees the stability/balance of the social fabric.
        * The reason for imbalance is attributed to the figure of the Jew whose "excessive" accumulation and greed are the cause of social antagonism.
        * Elimination of the Jew, everybody would again occupy his own place, in contrast to capitalism's constant social displacement.
* Reemergence of nationalism in Eastern Europe as a shock-absorber against sudden exposure to the capitalist openness and imbalance.
    * Since the social body is experienced as that of a nation, the cause of any imbalance "spontaneously" assumes the form of a "national enemy".

### The Blind Spot of Liberalism

What Eastern Europe needs most is more alienation; establishment of an "alienated" State which would maintain its distance from the civil society, not embodying any particular community's dream, keeping the space open for them all.
* Anti-nationalist liberal Eastern European intellectuals are fascinated by nationalism. The intellectual pleasure procured by denouncing nationalism is close to the satisfaction of successfully explaining one's own impotence and failure.
* Truly radical critique of ideology should go beyond the self-congratulatory "social analyses" which continue to participate in the fantasy that sustains the object of their critique.
    * Fantasy designates the hard kernel which resists symbolic "perlaboration", anchors an ideology in some "substantial" point and thus provides a constant frame for the symbolic interplay.

Ambivalence toward the other's fantasmatic enjoyment is positively expressed in the obsessive attitude. Political correctness is the compulsive effort to uncover new, more refined forms of racial and/or sexual violence and domination.
* Neurotic compulsion; it is not severe enough: the PC type is not ready to renounce what really matters, the very gesture of self-sacrifice.
* PC conceals a patronizing elevation over those whose injuries from discrimination are allegedly compensated.
    * In the act of emptying the white-male-heterosexual position of all positive content, the PC attitude retains it as a universal form of subjectivity.
    * What this attitude really fears is that the problem will disappear.
* PC is the main ideological protective shield of the bourgeois liberalism against a genuine leftist alternative.

What disturbs liberals is enjoyment organized in the form of self-sufficient ethnic communities.
* School busing; reinforced/generated racism where previously there was a desire of an ethnic community to maintain the closure of its way of life.
    * Desire for closure is not in itself "racist".
* Frankfurt school's "authoritarian personality" designates that form of subjectivity which irrationally insists on its specific way of life and resists liberal proofs of its supposed "true interests" in the name of its self-enjoyment.
    * The theory is an expression of left-liberal intellegentsia's ressentiment of the fact that the working classes were not prepared to accept its guidance.
* Rawls' theory of distributive justice overlooks the fantasy dimension; it relies on "rational" individuals who are able to abstract their particular position of enunciation, look from a neutral place of pure "metalanguage".
    * Within the fantasy-space, what "we" desire is linked to what we perceive as the other's desire, so that what "we" desire may turn out to be the destruction of our object of desire.
    * Human desire can never be grounded in our "true interests": the ultimate assertion of our desire is to act *against* our Good.

Every "enlightened" political action legitimized by the reference to "true interests" encounters the resistance of a particular fantasy space in the guise of the logic of "envy", of the "theft of enjoyment".
* Fear of "excessive" identification is the fundamental feature of the late-capitalist ideology: the Enemy is the "fanatic" who "over-identifies" instead of maintaining a proper distance toward the dispersed plurality of subject-positions.
* The dispersed, plural subject hailed by postmodern theory simply designates the form of subjectivity that corresponds to late capitalism.

### Spinozism, or, the Ideology of Late Capitalism

Spinozist position: leveling of the signifying chain, getting rid of the gap that separates S2 from S1. 
* The Spinozist substance designates universal Knowledge as having no need for support in a Master-Signifier (metonymical universe of "pure positivity" prior to the intervention of the negativizing cut of the paternal metaphor).
* Reduction of deontology to ontology, of injunction to rational knowledge, of performative to constative.
* Injunctions and prohibitions are justified only where we have to deal with primitive minds which lack rational insight.
* By surmounting our finitude, we conceive phenomena as the elements of a universal symbolic network which has no use for the exceptional element of S1.
* Kant vs Spinoza: Spinoza has no use for injunction, Kant insists in the fact of injunction being irreducible; subjects cannot assume the contemplative position which would enable us to reduce imperative to constative.
    * Kant introduces the radical responsibility of the subject.
* Late capitalism is Spinozist:
    * Replacing punishment and responsibility with illumination of the causes of our socially unacceptable behavior.
        * "Guilt" becomes ignorance of the causes which drove me into destructive behavior.
    * Replacement of direct injunction (S1) by the allegedly neutral information is led by the superego-imperative "Enjoy!".
    * Deleuze: individuals do not form a community through the mutual recognition of the ego and its Other
        * The subject is a place, passive ground for the network of partial lateral links: communication does not take place between subjects but directly between affects.
    * Spinozist mechanism at work in "postindustrial society of consumption"; postmodern subject is the passive ground traversed by partial affective links, reacting to images which regulates his/her "passions", unable to exert control over this mechanism.
    * Solipsist shift: the subject has withdrawn from the big Other, maintaining a protopsychotic distance toward the Other. The subject perceives himself as an out-Law, lacking the common ground shared with others.
* "Fundamentalism" (self-destructive "radical Evil") is a reaction to the ruling Spinozism, is its inherent Other.

### Dreams of Nationalism, Explained by the Dream of Radical Evil

There is no way out of late-capitalist Spinozism as long as the universal dimension of our social formation remains defined in terms of Capital.
* Ecological movement invents forms of political practice that contain a dimension of universality beyond Capital.
* Supposedly "neutral" liberal-democratic framework produces nationalist "closure" as its inherent opposite.
* The only way to prevent the emergence of protofascist nationalist hegemony is to call into question the standard of "normality", the universal framework of liberal-democratic capitalism.
* Freud's answer to anti-semitism is to demonstrate that Jews are already in themselves "decentered", that their "originality" is a bricolage.
    * The anti-Semite is the one who "believes in the Jew", so the only way effectively to undermine anti-Semitism is to content that Jews do not possess "it".

The project of formal democracy opens up the space for "fundamentalism". Kant with formal democracy:
* Both founding gestures are act of radical emptying.
    * Kant, empty locus of the Supreme Good
    * Democracy, empty locus of power, every pretender to this place is by definition a "pathological" usurper.
* Nationalism is modern phenomenon, the moment when the Nation, the national Thing, usurps, fills out, the empty place of the Thing opened by Kant's formalism.
* Kantian formalism (distinction between negative and indefinite judgment) opens up the space for the "undead" and radical Evil.
    * Kant circumscribes the space of nationalism but prohibits us from taking the step into it.
    * Nationalism is the transcendental illusion of a direct access to the Thing, epitomizes the principle of fanaticism in politics.
* Paradox of filling-out the empty place of the Supreme Good defines the modern notion of Nation. They are not "leftovers from the past", their place is constituted by the very break of modernity.

Liberal democracy a priori cannot be universalized: triumphant liberal-democratic new world order is more and more marked by a frontier separating its "inside" from its "outside".
* Opposition between the inside and outside, "socialist" bloc was the true "third way", desperate attempt at modernization outside the constraints of capitalism.
* The liberal gaze functions according to the same logic as "closed" nationalist-corporatist societies insofar as it is founded upon the exclusion of the Other to whom one attributes the fundamentalist nationalism etc.

Sendero Luminoso enacts an "infinite judgment" upon the universalist claim of liberal capitalism.
* Hegel, "rabble" as a necessary product of the modern society, necessary structural surplus excluded from the closed circuit of social edifice.
* Senderistas, idea to reinscribe the construction of socialism within the frame of the return to the ancient Inca empire.
    * Result is a double negation: anticapitalism coupled with systematic dissolution of all traditional hierarchical social links.
    * Capitalism cannot reproduce itself without the support of precapitalist forms of social links.
* Attempt to avoid the imbalance constitutive of capitalism without seeking support in some previous tradition supposed to enable us mastery of this imbalance.
    * Act of creative sublimation.
* Any true return to tradition is a priori impossible, its role is simply to serve as a shock-absorber for the process of modernization.

Postmodern racism which rages around Europe vs traditional form of racism.
* Traditional racism was direct and raw, new racism is "reflected" and can assume the form of its opposite, of the fight against racism.
    * Balibar: meta-racism.
    * "There is no metalanguage": the distance of meta-racism toward racism is void; meta-racism is racism pure and simple, all the more dangerous for posing as its opposite and advocating racist measures as the very form of fighting racism.

### The Eastern European "Vanishing Mediators"

Peculiarity of the "transition" from real socialism to capitalism.
* "Open" condition before elections → "closure" after elections, *vanishing mediator*:
    * A system establishes itself as a synchronous totality when it "posits" its external presuppositions as its inherent moments and thus obliterates the traces of its traumatic origins.
    * Kierkegaard; tension between possibility and necessity; the circle is closed when the new social pact establishes itself in its necessity and renders invisible its "possibility", the undecided process that engendered it.
* Primitive accumulation of democracy in punkers, students with sit-ins etc. Which literally became invisible the moment the new system established itself and therewith its own myth of origins.

Ideology must be disengaged from the "representationalist" problematic: ideology has nothing to do with "illusion", with a wrong, distorted representation of its social content.

### Collapse of the "Big Other"

The agent who initially triggered the process must come to be perceived as its main impediment.
* "Nation" as the substantial support is what the new ruling ideology sees so that it can NOT SEE, overlook, the "vanishing mediator": "nation" is the fantasy which fills out the void of the vanishing mediator.
* The past is always strictly "synchronous', it is the way a synchronous universe thinks its antagonism.
    * "National heritage is an ideological fossil created retroactively by the ruling ideology in order to blur its present antagonism.

"Real socialism" was ultimately a society of "pure appearance"; the system functioned so that nobody "believed in it"--- but this appearance was "an essential appearance"
* Disintegration of the big Other
* All moment of the big Other's collapse were unpredictable.
* Purely symbolic change, shift in the symbolic texture which constitutes the social bond.

*Servitude volontaire*; belief in the existence of the big Other.
* Difference between self-sacrifice for the despot vs self-sacrifice in the fight against the despot:
    * Obsessional neurosis: I am ready to do anything, inclusive of X, only to avoid X
    * In sacrificing myself for the despot, I retain my place in the big Other, whereas risking one's life against the despot entails the loss of my support in the big Other, my exclusion from the community, from the social order epitomized by the despot's name.
