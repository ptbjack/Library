[9:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=598) It is only in the post-Hegelian thought (Freud's death drive, pure repetition) can we get the fundamental operation in Hegel.

[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=730) What Hegel can't think:
- Repetition; Kierkegaard and Freud, non-productive repetition. In Hegel, there is always sublation repetition (passage from in-itself to for-itself). Deleuze: because he cannot think of pure repetition, Hegel cannot think of the radically new.
- Hegel: tautological repetition means some concept is not up to its name, it has failed.

[18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=1120) Unconscious:
- Hegel: Sense perception, "Now": unconscious is the universal form opposed to the particular content of my conscious thought. (You don't see the formal aspect i.e. the inner necessity of the passage from one figure of consciousness to the other)
- Freud, particular lateral connections, associations.

[24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=1462) Over-determination:
- Hegel, universal species comprises itself as its own subspecies (oppositional determination)
- Marx, Grundrisse; production is the genus and one of its species.
- Hegel deals with radical clear cuts vs Freud discusses opportunistic compromises (condensation, displacement etc.).
- Hyppolite: dialectics of repression and the return of the repressed, negation of negation. But in Freud, nothing gets resolved, rhizomatic associations, not triadic structure.

[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=1936) Jameson: Hegel's notion of society remains at the pre-capital level.

[35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=2126) Infinity:
- true infinity is that of subjective self-relating.
- Marx: capital is automatic subject (capital is both bad infinity and good infinity).

[37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=2241)Hegel views mathematics as pre-dialectic, abstract. BUT infinitismal calculus functions in speculative way.

[40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=2400) Lalangue:
- Hegel: thinking is in language but also against language; fighting contingency in language by mobilizing it in its most stupid and contingent.

[45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=2749)Freud, unconscious and form: pregnant woman's unclear dream signals that the father of the baby is unclear.

[48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=2898)Hegel: Freedom of thought only within language, but you learn a language by internalizing its mechanical rules.

[50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=3028)Lacan: self-consciousness is an object.
- Hegel: state is self-consciousness of state, activity of state is self-declarations. State remarks (Derrida) itself in ceremonies.
- reflexive registration in symptom: "I had a good time", I register my truth symbolically and internal thoughts "I hate you, I should go" is wrong.

[56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=3364)Allegory vs symbol
- Allegory is melancholic, treats a present object as already-loss. Melancholy is pre-emptive mourning.
- Symbol: potential future of prosperity in the pile of rubble, the ruin.

[1:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=3764)Dolar: Freud's Ver are not clear negations.
- Verdrängung: repression but not quite (there is no pure repression, there is always the return of the repressed).
- Verwerfung: foreclosure is repression without the return?
- Verschiebung: displacement
- Verdichtung: condensation
- Isolierung: taking something into account, fact loses symbolic efficiency when taken out of context.
	- China, Mao's crimes: saying it functions as a block to any further mention of it.
- Aufstoßung: I have to lose part of myself in order to draw the external line between me and not-me.

Hegel's negativity is radical, simple.

[1:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrH5O2ZB7E&t=4047)Zero level of negativity is excessive stucking to something.
- Drive, compulsion to repeat
- Animals vs humans: animals move on, humans have fixation to impossible object.

Freedom is being stuck onto something.
- Hegel: being stuck onto particular something is ultimate assertion of autonomy.
** The object doesn't matter, the message is my arbitrary fixation.

Answer without a question: prohibition of incest (Levi-Strauss)
The core of Hegelian negativity is in Kierkegaard and Freud, but the question has to be a Hegelian one.
