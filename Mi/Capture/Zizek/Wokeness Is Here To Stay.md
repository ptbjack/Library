Sexuality cannot be established by a direct reference to how we feel, it is not a simple form of identity.
- Scotland rapist imprisoned with women then with men.

Puberty blockers: "sexual maturation" is a long, complex, mostly unconscious process full of violent tensions and reversals.
- combination of politically correct badgering with the brutal calculation of financial interests.
- **woke capitalism**

Wokeness and religious fundamentalism: similarity in the form of the two discourses.
- Wokeness operates as a secularized religious dogma.

Conlict of forms between seminar and workshop:
- Seminar: focused on particular text, open discussion with interventions.
- PC workshops: everyone says yes again and again, **the main argument against those who are not accepted as sincere partisans is "harm".**

Woke cult combines beliefs in objectivized dogmas with full trust in how one feels.
- "Open debate" seems racist, white-supremacist notion. "Objective facts are a tool of white supremacy".

How does wokeness manage to neuralize the larger liberal and leftist space, instilling a fear about openly opposing the woke?
- **Superego** : you must but you can't, because you shouldn't -- the greatest sin is to do what you should strive for. The more we obey the superego commandment, the guiltier we feel.
- Superego pressure, thrill provided by self-probing PC.
- **Submitting to woke demands offers people an easy way out -- you gladly assume your guilt insofar as this enables you to go on living the way you did**.
	- Protestant logic of "do whatever you want, just feel guilty for it."

Wokeness is escaping the Real in the dream: the woke awaken us to racism and sexism precisely to enable us to go on sleeping; ignoring the true roots and depths of our racial and sexual traumas.
