# I

Marxism vs modern science:
- Marxism is the paradox of objective "true" knowledge accessible only through a subjective partial position. A revolutionary theory is immanently practical.
- Modern science forecloses subjectivity.

Ethical act is doing "simple things that are hard to do" ([[Brecht]]) e.g. nationalizing banks, expanding health service.
- **Revolutionaries have to begin with crazy simple acts**, later they should become pragmatic. Allende in Chile, they violated the existing "pragmatic rules".
- [[Chiesa]]: **irreducible oscillation** between moments of suspending "the reality principle" and the long "pragmatic" process of transforming revolutionary goals into moments of ordinary social reality of the majority.
	- Oscillation is NOT between the One of full engagement and cynical acceptance of not-One / messy reality.
- Unity of fanatical principled stance and ruthless pragmatism is **the ability to analyze a concrete situation and simplify it to the abstract choice, neglecting the wealth of inessential features.** Thinking begins by learning to abtract and ignore the irrelevant data.

## The Need for an Enemy

***What characterizes an authentic emancipatory thought is not a vision of conflict-free future, but the properly dialectical notion of antagonism which is totally incompatible with the Rightist topic of the need for an enemy to assert our self-identity."***

Cosmism in Russia, both scientific and religious-scientific, follows "god became man so that man will become god": The goals of religion (collective paradise, overcoming of all suffering, victory over time and death) can be realized in terrestrial life through the development of modern science and technology.
- Russian Orthodox
- Prostestan Martin Luther: man is an excrement of God

## From Athings to Apersons

Limits of liberalism, the third space of public-private media is not free, it is a space in which control and manipulation thrive even more.
- Team Jorge, election manipulation, Cambridge Analytica

Creating a virtual person who doesn't exist in reality but can interact digitally as a real person is possible only because I am already an aperson: I am never directly "myself", **I refer to myself as a symbolic and imaginary construction which never directly coincides with the real of my subjectivity.**
- What remains of us is just an empty *cogito* dominated by multiple versions of Descartes' *malin genie*.

## Ethics versus Morality

Wokeism and political correctness are gradually being "normalized".
- Cancel culture: something very particular that you did (or are) can be unexpectedly elevated into the universal status of an unforgivable mistake. Every particular case gives its own spin to a fuzzy universality.

**Hainamoration**: an object others love to hate (Lacan).
- Rightists, by politically correct. Desire to remain in focus, **better hatred than indifference**. 

Stiff moralism of politically correct cancel culture misses the proper ethical stance:
- *The Menu (2022)* the chef who poisons the haute cuisine guests is immoral but ethical.

## Awaken to Continue to Sleep

Language of harm: a harm becomes anything that makes you feel not quite right.

The woke elite are aware that they will not achieve their goal of diminishing oppression, they don't even want that. They want what they are achieving: **position of moral authority from which they terrorize all others without effectively changing the social relations of domination**.

[[Johnston]]: libidinal unconscious mechanisms are at work already in the heart of the "economic base": individuals caught in capitalist reproduction do not follow their egotist interests, **they are ready to renounce many life pleasures as instruments of capital's drive to ever-expanding reproduction**.
