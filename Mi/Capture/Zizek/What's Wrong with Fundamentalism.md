# I. With or Without Passion

**Fetishistic disavowal** at work in the functioning of the symbolic order, mask-mandate matters more than the direct reality of the individual who wears this mask / assumes this mandate.
- Groucho Marx: "Whom do you believe, your eyes or my words?" I effectively believe his words, i.e. in Another Space (domain of pure symbolic authority) than in the direct reality of this person of judge.
- Not being caught in the symbolic deception/fiction, **les non-dupes errent**.
- A minimum of idealization is the basis of our co-existence.
- Sublime beauty in Anne Frank's idealization of essential goodness of Man; meta-physical gesture, active will to disavow the actual state of things.
	- The big Other is the order of lie, of lying sincerely.

[[Yeats]]: "the ceremony of innocence is drowned; / the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity"
- anemic liberals who are no longer able to sustain their full engagement in the symbolic ritual and fundamentalists full of passionate intensity

**Reflexivity of belief**: one has to believe in belief itself.
- [[Kierkegaard]]: we do not really believe in christ, we just believe to believe
- [[Bohr]]: one can also NOT believe one's beliefs
	- Mocking the Freudian notion of phallus by ironically: the naive orthodox Freudian who sees "phallic symbols everywhere" does not exist, he is a fiction of the critic himself, his "subject supposed to believe." The only believer is the critic himself, who projects/transposes his belief onto the fictive other.
- True logic of [[Pascal]] in the cynical functioning of ideology, displacing belief onto another: "Kneel down and you will thereby *make someone else believe*"
	- inversion of Pascal's formula: one kneels downs and prays to get rid of one's believe and its over-proximity -- gaining minimal distance.
- Negation of negation of belief, a self-relating fake: "I fake to fake to believe" = "I really believe without being aware of it."
	- irony  (taking words more seriously than the characters) as critique of ideology

Fundamentalists: belief, transposed onto the Other is disturbed by the violent return of the immediate belief.
- Fantasies fulfill their function by us "not taking them seriously", the fundamentalist lacks this minimal distance towards his fantasy.

[[Lacan]]: "Love is giving something one doesn't have..."
- True love is performative, it changes its object in the sense of opening up a gap in it: the gap between what I am as a determinate being and the unfathomable X in me which causes love (positive properties vs agalma)

Fundamentalist loses his sensitivity for the enigma of the Other's desire: encounter of the "enigmatic signifier" of the desire of the Other in all its impenetrablity is redouble alienation, separation as overlapping of two lacks.
- Rape perpetrator's enigmatic gesture of putting on condom.
- Since fantasy is a scenario the subject builds in order to answer the enigma of the Other's desire, answer to "What does the Other want from me?", immediate identification with the fantasy closes up the gap: enigma is clarified, we fully know he answer.

Evil:
- Standard notion of doubling, abandoning reference to the big Other, turning away from the original divine One.
- Postmodern retort: abandoning the very presupposition of the primordial One. Our primordial situation is complex, one witin a multitude of foreign elements.
	- Evil is the imposition of an all-encompassing One onto the primordial dispersal.
- Zizek: self-division of the One, One itself is split within itself.
	- Gnosticism and monotheism on Evil:
		- Gonisticism locates the primordial duality of Good and Evil into God.
		- Monotheism saves one-ness of a good God by locating the origin of evil into our freedom. Evil is either finitude as such or the spiritual act of wilfully turning away from God.
		- Together; Gnostic duality is a "reflexive determination" of our own changed attitude towards God: what we perceive as two Gods is the split in our own relating to God.
	- True task is locating the source of the split into God while remaining within the field of monotheism.

Hegelian triad in existence of God and the fact of shoah:
1. reconciling the existence of God and the fact of shoah:
	1. Legalistic sin-and-punishment theory: shoah is punishment for past sins of Jews
	2. Moralistic character-eduation theory: if we survive this ordeal, our character will stand firm.
	3. Divine mystery theory: the fact of shoah bears witness to the unfathomable abyss of divine will.
		- Redoubled mystery: the mystery of God for us has to be also a mystery for God Himself. Denying God's full sovereignty and omnipotence.
2. Shoah and divine limitation:
	1. God is finite, overwhelmed by the dense inertia of his own creation
	2. God is self-limited, he voluntarily constrained his power in order to leave the space open for human freedom
	3. Externalized self-limitation, dualistic solution of a principle of Evil active in the world.
3. Suffering God who assumes the burden in solidarity with the human misery.
	- [[Schelling]]: "God is a life, not merely a being... God is affected by history, his suffering means that human history is not just a theater of shadows, but the place of the real struggle in which the fate of the Absolute itself is decided."
	- The excess of the suffering in Shoah makes it divine.

Secular-humanist reactions to shoah and gulag are insufficient. Paradox of the theological significance of shoah: it is usually conceived as the ultimate challenge to theology, at the same time only theology can provide the frame enabling us to approach the scope of this catastrophy.
# II. Move the Underground!

The explicit ideological text/practice is sustained by the seires of obscene superego supplement.
- "Really Existing Socialism", unspoken obscene injuntions and prohibitions.
- Moving the underground (*acheronta movebo*) is a practice of the critique of ideology, intervening into ideology's obscene virtual supplement.
	- The truly radical intervention into military homophobia should focus primarily on this supplement and disturb the implicit homosexual practices which sustain the explicit homophobia.

Abu Ghraib prison torture in US invasion, Saddam regime tortured on brutal infliction of pain while the US soldiers focused on psychological humiliation.
- Photos of prisoners, "theatre of cruelty"
- similar to US initiatic rituals of closed communities.
	- "But Americans freely choose to undergo the ritual" - worker's freedom to sell his working force.
- Obscene core of Western way of life

Catholic Church, paedophilia seduction using religion, **transubstantiation** by means of which the prohibiting Law which makes us feel guilty apropos an ordinary sin is enacted in the guise of a much stronger sin.
- Law coincides with the strongest transgression.
- "morality is the most dark and daring of conspiracies": US politics is mobilizing morality, "sincere" democratic strivings.

*A Few Good Men*, code red represents the "Spirit of community" at its purest, exerting pressure on individuals to enact group identification.
- over-identification with the military power system turns one into the excess which the system has to eliminate.
	- *Apocalypse Now*

Guantanamo prisoners' status is "those who were missed by the bombs".
- [[Agamben]]: *homo sacer*, the one who can be killed with impunity since his life no longer counts in the eyes of the law (living dead).
- US authorities which treat them as such are also in-between legal status: acting as legal power, their acts are no longer covered and constrained by law -- they operate in an empty space that is still within the domain of the law.

Contemporary capitalism's economic strategy is outsourcing (giving over the "dirty") process of material production..

Rumsfeld, "unknown knowns": unconscious, "knowledge which doesn't know itself".
- Disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices which form the background of our public values.
- Abu Ghraib, no direct orders, just unofficial pressure, hints delievered in private.

[[Huntington]], "clash of civilizations" isa clash between anonymous brutal torture and torture as a mediatic spectacle in which victims' bodies serve as the anonymous background for the stupidly smiling "innocent American" faces of the torturers themselves.
- every clash of civilizations is the clash of underlying barbarisms.

Obscene virtual dimension is inscribed in the guise of the fantasmatic background that sustains the emptiness of the Master-Signifier.
- As signifier of potentiality and potential threat (only expressed as tautology "Nation is the Thing itself")
- Emptiness of the threat "You will see.." solicits the power of my fantasy to fill it in with imagined horrors.
	- Function of fantasy is to fill in the void of the signifier-without-signified, it is the stuff which fills in the void of the Master-Signifier. **constitutive excess of representation over the reepresented.**
- Law, at the level of the superego underside, is supplemented by the obscene message of unconditional exercise of Power: laws do not really bind me, I can do to you whatever I want.
	- necessary constituent of the notion of sovereignty. there is a structural asymmetry: the law can only sustain its authority if subjects hear in it the echo of the obscene unconditional self-assertion.
- Anti-Semitism; Jew is the Master-Signifier, empty reference point which accounts for the inconsistent series of phenomena that bother people.

**Redoubled (reflected-into itself) link between power and invisible threat**: the place of the threat is externalized, displaced into the Outside. The invisible threat of the Enemy legitimizes the permanent state of emergency of the existing Power.
- Omnipresent invisible threat of Terror legitimizes the all too visible protective measures of defense.
- Classical power functioned as threat never actualizing itself (nuclear threat)
- War on terror, invisible threat causes the incessant actualization of the measures against itself.
