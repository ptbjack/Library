# Introduction: The Unorientable Space of Dialectical Materialism

Because of the inconsistent nature of sexuality, its elevation into the new Absolute necessarily fails.
* The "woman question": it cannot be resolved by a new post-patriarchal symbolization of femininity nor the elevation of woman into an entity which resists symbolization.
    * Schelling: woman as the "indivisible remainder" of the process of symbolization.
        * Logos → mythos: break out of the logical structure of reality is also an assertion of the Feminine.
        * Female orgasm is the high point of human evolution, ontological proof of God, our point of contact with the Absolute.
        * Bliss is not only the Aristotelian thought thinking itself, it is also a body enjoying itself to the almost unbearable maximum.
    * Minimal reflexivity, convoluted structure, unorientable.
        * Purely formal reflexivity.
        * Surface: Möbius strip, cross-cap, Klein bottle: there exists a closed path such that the directix is reversed when moved around this path.
            * No way to consistently define the notions of "right" or "left" since anything that is slid on it will come back to its starting point as a mirror image.
* The theoretical space of dialectical materialism is convoluted (falling-back-into-oneself).

Stalin's general theory of dialectical materialism (DM1) vs dialectical materialism of a failed ontology (DM2):
* DM1: Nature as connected, integral whole in which phenomena are organically connected with, dependent on, and determined by each other.
    * DM2: separation, cut, isolation, truth from isolating the key feature of a totality and viewing the whole from this unique partial standpoint.
        * Truth is subjective, "one-sided".
* DM1: Nature is a state of continuous movement and change, where something is always arising and developing and something always disintegrating and dying away.
    * DM2: function of delays and "dead time" in gestation. Leaps happen too early or too late for structural reasons.
        * Hegel: Change takes place when we notice that it has already taken place.
* DM1: Development, progress, qualitative changes occur rapidly and abruptly, taking the form of a leap from one state to another.
    * DM2: progress is always localized, the overall picture is that of a circular movement of repetition.
* DM1: Internal contradictions are inherent in all things and phenomena of nature.
    * DM2: antagonism as the constitutive contradiction of an entity with itself: external opposite that poses a threat to their stability is always the externalization of their immanent self-blockage and inconsistency.
* *Ontological parallax*: change in observational position is not simply "subjective", subject and object are inherently "mediated" so that an "epistemological" shift in the subject's point of view always reflects an "ontological" shift in the object itself.
    * Ontological difference: the ontological dimension cannot be reduced to the ontic one.
        * Ontic: reality as whole that we are part of. (e.g. cognitive science, evolutionary science)
            * Has to presuppose that the modern scientific approach to reality is already here since it is only through its lens that reality appears as an object of scientific explanation.
        * Transcendental-ontological approach cannot explain the fact of contingent external reality.
        * Irreducible gap
* German Idealism (Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) articulate distance towards idealist subjectivity, they struggled with how to break out of the horizon of absolute subjectivity without regressing to pre-transcendental realism.
* Materialism without matter: purely formal materialism of quanta etc. which move in a dematerialized space.
    * True materialism always implies a "disappearance" of matter in a network of formal relations.
* The worst idealism is the one masked as evolutionary materialism, a vision of reality as an organic whole which gradually develops itself into more and more complex forms.
* Dialectical materialism is a theory of twisted, curved surfaces, depth is an effect of convoluted surface.
* Anti-deconstructionist turn, positive vision of what reality is, succumb to the charms of a new ontological edifice full of thriving multitudes.
    * BUT every ontology fails, a failure echoes the thwarted character of reality itself.

Theorem III: being, essence, notion --- Möbius strip, cross cap, Klein bottle.
* The triad enables us to grasp different aspects of one and the same phenomenon.
    * Class struggle:
        * Möbius strip: continuing on the line of objective social relations brings us to social struggle
        * Cross cap: cut of social antagonism
        * Klein bottle: inward-turn of subjectivization
    * Quilting point:
        * Möbius strip: signifier falls into its opposite, signified
        * Cross-cap: quilt as the impossible bridge between the two levels
        * Klein bottle: quilting as the point of subjectivization
    * Möbius strip renders the continuous passage of a concept into its opposite (being into nothingness, quantity into quality etc.)
    * Cross-cap introduces a cut into this continuity, the cut makes the relationship between two opposites that of reflection
        * Pure difference, difference between appearance and essence, a thing and its properties, cause and its effects
    * Klein bottle, subjectivity: circle of reflexivity is brought to the Absolute, cause becomes nothing but an effect of its effects

In the book,
* A theorem stands for the universal genus, universal axiom
* Its corollary stands for its species (every genus has only one species)
    * This species is in antagonism with its genus, imbalance because there is no second species for balanced Whole.
* The lack of species is filled in by the multiplicity of contingent scholia.

The task of thinking is not to fill the symbolic hole but to keep it open and render it operative in all its unsettling force.
* Triumph of the image over the symbolic


# Theorem I The Parallax of Ontology

Parallax gap: co-existence of two dimensions, realist and transcendental, which cannot be united in the same global ontological edifice.

Absolute Knowing--- silent knowledge, no explicit mutual recognition of the redoubled deception is necessary.

## Modalities of the Absolute

Is there any possible contact with the Absolute (a point somehow exempted from the permanent flux of reality)?
* Absolute as the ultimate substantial reality:
    * Hinduism; soul purifies itself of all accidental spiritual content, experiences its identity with the absolute foundation of all reality, achieves spiritual identity.
    * Spinoza; "intellectual love of god"
* Absolute as pure appearance:
    * The insight into the unreliability of the beloved woman announces the beginning of wisdom.
    * BUT, feminine beauty is nonetheless an absolute which appears; there is more truth in the appearance than in what is hidden beneath it.
    * Ideas are nothing but the very form of appearance, this form as such.
        * The Suprasensible is appearance as appearance.
* German idealism: intellectual intuition in which subject and object, activity and passivity coincide.
    * Transcendental reflexion: the Absolute of the unsurpassable self-relating of the totality of meaning.
    * E.g. historical materialism; no possibility of viewing ourselves 'objectively', 'as we really are' from some standpoint external to our social totality.
        * Concrete social totality provides meaning.
* 'Break' in nature which gives rise to the transcendental;
    * NOT de Sade, ecstatic outburst of destructive negativity.
    * Sexuality, not animalistic or natural, is the very terrain where humans detach themselves from nature.
    * Infinite passion, neither nature nor culture, is our contact with the Absolute and since it is impossible (self-destructive) to dwell in it, we escape into historicized symbolization.
* Hegel: The disparity between subject and substance is simultaneously the disparity of the substance with itself.
    * Lacan: disparity means that the lack of the subject is simultaneously the lack in the Other; subjectivity emerges when substance cannot achieve full identity with itself.
    * Idealism: thought-determinations are simultaneously determinations of being, there is no gap that separates the unknowable thing-in-itself from our knowledge.
        * BUT the limitations of thought are also simultaneously the limitations of being itself.
    * Christianity; alienation of god from himself.
        * Man can only achieve unity with god by identifying with the god abandoned by himself.
        * A Christian believer does not rejoin god directly, only through Christ as he is abandoned by god.
    * Marxism and Christianity; Marxism is too idealist liberation project without Christianity, the central motif of the lack in the Other makes Marxism truly materialist.
* *Absolute knowing*; redoubled ignorance, the violent twist through which we come to realize that our ignorance is simultaneously the ignorance in the heart of the Other itself.
* No unity prior to sundering, the unity lost through sundering retroactively emerged through sundering itself.
    * Hegel's *"absolute recoil"*; the substantial entity "recoils" from itself, divides itself from itself, the entity emerges through recoil as a retroactive effect of its division.
    * Words are by definition inadequate, but they retroactively create the very standard with regard to which they appear as inadequate.
    * Munchhausen bootstrapping joke, spirit defined by the feature of pulling oneself into existence out of the slough of nothingness.
        * Nature, photon with no mass: paradox of a thing which is always and nothing but an excess with regard to itself.
    * The failure of the material domain to fully render the functioning of the spirit is not external to spirit but is immanent to it, the spirit EMERGES through the failure of the material domain to render it fully.
        * The Absolute is rendered in the Sublime through the failure to be represented properly.
        * A material model fails to render adequately spiritual self-relating and it comes to be through this failed evocation.

Redoubled lack vs Meillassoux's transposing of the contingency of our perception of reality into reality itself.
* Meillassoux: correlationism reads the ultimate facticity of our reality as the mark of our finitude on account of which we are condemned to remain caught in the Veil of Ignorance separating us from the unknowable Absolute.
    * Facticity is not the sign of our epistemological limitation but the basic ontological feature of reality itself, the way it is independently of us.
    * The shadow of uncertainty that falls upon every description of the real is a feature of the real-in-itself: the real-in-itself is traversed by a bar of impossibility and is 'experimenting' with itself to construct flawed worlds.
    * Trying to demonstrate the possibility of cognition of the noumenal In-itself.
    * Primary vs secondary properties of objects;* mathematization*; "all those aspects of the object that can be formulated in mathematical terms can be meaningfully conceived as properties of the object in itself."
* Redoubled lack does not jump into a positive vision of reality-in-itself. After going through the overlapping of two lacks, we have to assume that every vision of objective reality remains irreducibly normative, not a fact but something that has to rely on the symbolic normativity.
    * The only non-normative fact is that of the gap of impossibility itself, of the bar that thwarts every ontological positivity.
## Reality and Its Transcendental Supplement

The predominant form of the gap today is that between reality in a naive positive sense of "all that exists" and the transcendental horizon within which reality appears to us. Two approaches in philosophy, transcendental and ontic;
* Ontic approach is kidnapped by the natural sciences; metaphysical questions can now be answered through experimental science and thus empirically tested.
    * Methodological and ontological presuppositions, science remains caught in the hermeneutic circle; the space of what it discovers remains predetermined by its approach.

Dialectical coincidence of opposites; the all-encompassing transcendental frame/horizon through which we perceive is simultaneously a mere supplement of what it frames.
* Reality deprived of its transcendental frame is an inconsistent mess of the Real, its consistency relies on a supplement which constitutes it as a whole.


Dynamized Kantianism: one insists on realism but our access to the real is always mediated by the symbolic practices of our life-world.
* How to move beyond the couple of reality and its transcendental horizon?
    * Question: what has to be constitutively excluded (primordially repressed) from our notion of reality?
* Transcendental approach misses the primordial gap that cuts within into the order of being making it non-all and inconsistent: difference as such, pure difference between something and Void (Something and its Difference).
    * Heidegger: Being IS difference itself, ontological difference.
    * Crack in the ontological edifice opens the space for the deontological dimension, for the order of what Ought-to-Be (normative vs factual).

Attempts to combine analytic thought with the Continental tradition remain caught in the Kantian split between brute positivity and the normative domain of meanings, argumentation and validity.
* Evolutionary positivism (Dennett, Pinker)
* Habermas: rules of communicative action function as a pragmatic a priori which cannot be reduced to the positive content since they are always-already presupposed in any approach to reality.
    * Pippin: the space of normative reason (argumentation, justification of validity) is irreducible to any positivist scientific explanation.
    * Lacan: transcendental circle unsurpassable, we are caught in it, whatever we perceive as its outside is already overdetermined by the symbolic totality.
    * Western Marxists: whatever we know about non-human external nature is already overdetermined by the totality of social praxis.
        * Lukacs: nature is always a social category.
    * Foucault: empirico-transcendental doublet: we are part of natural reality empirically, but transcendentally our ultimate horizon is that of symbolic praxis.
* Brandom: semantic idealism; semantic (and not ontological) identity of subjective and objective.

The full step from Kant to Hegel goes beyond the direct identity of the real and the ideal, objective and subjective: question of how reality has to be structured so that symbolic order can emerge in it.
* Positive reality prior to the explosion of the Symbolic has a crack in it, proto-deontological tension.
* Reality is not what is but what fails to be what it is, whose facticity is traversed by an impossibility.
* Vs materialist common sense where "nature in itself" is a chaotic indifferent non-All; Hegelian Real "in-itself" is the not-One in an active sense of "non" as a negation which presupposes a reference to the One. The One is there from the beginning as thwarted, traversed by an impossibility of being what it is. There is no indifference even at the most basic level.

We should aim at the notion of a non-transcendental subject, of subjectivity which precedes the transcendental dimension.
* Problem of the emergence of a self-relating "closed" system which has no outside since its constitutive act is self-relating, the system fully emerges once it starts to cause itself, to posit its presuppositions in a closed loop.
    * Emerges all of a sudden and creates its own past.
    * Althusser is transcendental: the structure is always-already here, it cannot be accounted for in genetic-historicist terms.
* Task is to indicate the "missing link" between before and after, what had to be repressed so that a synchronous structure can emerge.
* Synchronous structure always emerges "out of nothing", it cannot be reduced to its genetic predisposition, but this "nothing" can be specified.
* Derridian "always-already"; there is the Fall--- a gap, the violent cut of Difference which disturbs the eternal peace. This Fall/gap always-already happened, nothing precedes it, preceding Peace or Innocence is a retroactive illusion.
* Hegelian "always-already": cuts in eternity itself: something New emerges at a certain  temporal moment, changes not only the present and the future but the past itself, things become what they eternally were/are.
* Instead of asking what is Substance for Subject, ask the obverse question: what is the rise of the Subject for pre-subjective Substance.
    * E.g. Chesterton, what is man for animal?
        * Thinking backwards
        * Rendering palpable the open moment of decision is imagining how history may have taken a different turn.
    * E.g. what the global civilization is for uncontacted tribes; we see the terrified natives observing an inhuman Other, and we ourselves are this Other.
    * E.g. the Real in quantum physics is the collapse itself "in its becoming", as a movement, before it is stabilized into constituted reality.
        * The Real of sexual difference is difference "in its becoming", the movement of (self)differentiation which precedes the differentiated terms.
* The true in-itself is NOT the way things were before the symbolic Cut but this very cut seen from the standpoint of Before, in its becoming, not from within its perspective once it is established as the new order.
    * Meillassoux's critique of transcendental correlationism: we can access and think reality in itself.
        * Freudian discovery of the inherent twist/curvature that is constitutive of the subject itself is lost.
    * Lacan: irreducible constitutive discord between subject and reality: in order for the subject to emerge, the impossible object-that-is-subject must be excluded from reality, since it is its very exclusion which opens up the space for the subject.
* What escapes correlation is not In-itself of the object but the subject as object.
    * Lacan: split in subject between its thinking and its non-thought thought, its non-non-thought, between discourse and real.
    * Christian solution to fossils; *objet a*, the subject's impossible-real objectal counterpart, is "imagined" (fantasmatic, virtual) object which never positively existed in reality, it is directly created as a fossil.
* Object-oriented ontology remains transcendental: relies on an anthropomorphic return to the premodern enchanted world.
    * New materialism refuses the radical divide matter/life and life/thought; selves or multiple agents are everywhere in different guises.
    * It is not clear whether the vitality of material bodies is a result of our perception being animistic or of an actual asubjective vital power.
* Derrida's transcendental deadlock: two readings of "*il n'y a pas de hors-texte*"
    * 1. Transcendental: all ontological claims are always-already caught in the arche-transcendental dimension of writing, they are never directly about reality out there, they are overdetermined by texture of traces.
    * 2. Ontological: external reality, life, is already made of traces and differences, the structure of** différance** is the structure of all there is.
* Ambiguity regarding "metaphysics of presence":
    * Derrida: there is no outside to the metaphysics of Presence
    * Is metaphysics of presence the history of European philosophy? What about China?
* Recent shared insight: not all conceptions of nature are compatible without self-description as autonomous agents.
    * Strong interpretation: we are describing the way nature is in itself, independently of our observation and interaction with it.
    * Weak interpretation: our conception of nature is never truly a neutral view of nature-in-itself but remains embedded in our (human) standpoint, mediated by it.

## Varieties of the Transcendental in Western Marxism

"Transcendental Marxism" since the totality of social practice plays the role of the unsurpassable transcendental horizon of our cognition.

Initially, Lukacs and Korsch reacted to Neo-Kantians ("ethical socialism") who insisted on the gap between objective social reality and the normative realm of autonomous ethical goals which cannot be deduced from reality.
* Demanding unity of theory and practice, of the positive order of Being and ethical tasks
* Lukacs: revolutionary theory is in itself a form of practice, functions as an immanent moment of social totality.
    * Marxist knowledge is practical, changes its object into a revolutionary subject.
* Historical materialism is not "un-partial": truth about our society is available only from an engaged "partial" position.
    * "Reified"
        * Labor: labor as instrumental exploitation of objective laws of nature is "reified" since it maintains the position of external manipulation and treats reality as the independent domain of objects.
        * Natural sciences are "reified" as the knowledge of realty the way it is in itself, outside its mediation with subjectivity.

Marxism's history is traversed by the gap between realism and transcendentalism:
* Soviet dialectical materialism, naive-realist ontology.
* Western Marxism: collective human praxis as the ultimate transcendental horizon of understanding
    * Lukacs: nature as social category, nature overdetermined by the social totality in which we dwell.
    * Unbridgeable gap between ontic view of reality and the transcendental role of social praxis.

Tragic dimension of the revolutionary subject: true function of the Revolution was to establish the condition for the reign of bourgeois economy.
* True heroism in recognizing *"the rose in the cross of the present"*: abandoning the position of the Beautiful Soul and accepting the present as the only possible domain of actual freedom.
* Marx, original limitation of the "bourgeois" revolutionary project is the falsity of its promise of universal freedom: the "truth" of the universal human rights are the rights of commerce and private property.
* Pessimist perspective: the Communist project of realizing "actual freedom" necessarily fails in its first attempt and it can be salvaged only through its repetition.

Late Lukacs: ontology of social being
* Social ontology as a special sphere of general ontology
* Labor as the elementary form of teleology
    * Vs Aristotelian and Hegelian idealism, social labor as the primary domain of teleology, a domain which remains a small part of nature and arises spontaneously out of biological processes.
* Reification:
    * Young Lukacs: every objectivization is reification
    * Late Lukacs: there is no necessary reification at work in labor. Reification occurs only when labor is exercised in social conditions of alienation.
* Naive realism, ontology of hierarchal levels.

Priority of the second death (annihilation of the entire life-cycle of generation and corruption) over the first death (a moment of this cycle): there is no big Other, no Nature as an ontologically consistent realm.
* Sade's ultimate crime, second death, total negation comes at the beginning and not the end, it stands for the zero-level starting point out of which the fragile/inconsistent reality emerges.
* Sadean Nature remains a Substance, not as Subject ("subject" as the immanent incompleteness-inconsistency-antagonism of Substance itself)
    * ... as subject = death drive; Sadeian will-to-extinction is premised on a fetishistic denial of the death drive.
        * Apocalyptic vision of an absolute Crime functions as a screen against a more intractable internal split of subjectivity.
        * The florid imagination masks the fact that the Other is barred, inconsistent, it cannot be served for it presents no law to obey.
* Free autonomous act cannot be accounted for in terms of natural causality, it already suspends natural causality and subject as $ is this cut in the natural circuit, self-sabotage of natural goals.
    * The subject itself is the catastrophe it fears and tries to avoid.

Western Marxism is constrained by the transcendental role of social practice and the radical negativity as the crack in the real is foreclosed by transcendental thought, then returns in the real as the phantasmagoria of a total world-destruction.
* The way out of the deadlock is to abandon the starting point and to admit that there is no reality as a self-regulated Whole, that reality is in itself cracked, incomplete, non-all, traversed by radical antagonism.


Adorno, reconciling materialist "primacy of the objective" with idealist legacy of the subjective mediation of all objective reality.
* Accepting transcendental horizon, everything we experience as immediately given is already mediated
* Idealist stance fethishizes subjectivity itself into a given immediacy.
* Kantian transcendental a priori does not simply absolutize the subjective mediation, it obliterates its own historical mediation. Categories are historically mediated conceptual network.
* The "priority" is the very result of the mediation brought to its end, kernel of resistance in the guise of the absent point of reference on account of which every mediation ultimately fails.
* *Negative dialectics*; a position which includes its own failure, produces the truth-effect through its very failure.
    * Not a definitive doctrine, it is a result, "inconsistent", a process of thought.
    * Lacanian symbolically mediated reality and the impossible Real: accessible positive objectivity and objectivity targeted in the "priority of the objective".
    * Rejecting the very notion of dialectical reconciliation, one should renounce the demand for a "true" reconciliation.
        * In reconciliation, one does not change external reality to fit some idea, one recognizes this Idea as the inner "truth" of this miserable reality itself.
        * Passage to reconciliation through changing NOT reality but the way we perceive it and relate to it.
        * Hegelian reconciliation is the reconciliation with antagonisms.

Political positions and stances towards ontology:
* Neo-Kantianism grounds social-democratic reformism
* Early Lukacs's Hegelianism grounds his radical Leninist engagement
* Ontology of dialectical materialism grounds Stalinist politics
* Late Lukacs ontology of social being grounds utopian hopes of humanist reform of the really-existing Socialist regimes
* Negative dialectics echoes absence of ant radical emancipatory prospect 

Solution is return to Hegel (NOT early Lukacs total subjective mediation of objectivity). Subject should recognize itself in its Otherness:
* NOT as a tiny cog in some substantial cosmic order.
* Subject recognizes its own lack, limitation, as grounded in the lack, limitation that pertains to the cosmic order itself.
* The order itself is incomplete, traversed by an impossibility.

## The Margin of Radical Uncertainty

A true materialist should refuse to accept "objective reality" in order to undermine consistent subjectivity.

* Radical incommensurability of events and their meanings.
* Atheism: impossibility, necessary failure of the attempt, to formulate a Meaning that would cover it all.
* Even if the horizon of infinite justice is posited as purely virtual, it operates in our symbolic universe. Materialism demands from us to fully renounce it.

Radical relativity of our notion of the universe, we always presuppose our gaze, our "normal" measures of greatness.

* Every notion of "objective reality" is bound to a subjective point and it is not possible to locate our reality in an overall constellation.
* We cannot say for sure how things are in themselves, Lacan's basic materialism is accompanied by assertions of agnosticism with regard to the "highest" questions.
    * Even in the case that God and Soul exist, his materialist theory will be no less true: "God" functions as a symbolic fiction, our universe is that of radical finitude/mortality within which "eternal soul" is a fantasy.
    * Religion is a fake even it is true as to its content.

The only real accessible to us is the excess of our subjectivity: the blind spot which eludes our subjective grasp is not nature-in-itself but the way our subjectivity fits into it. The blind spot is subject itself as object.

* The point where we touch the Real is not the X we are gradually approaching through new scientific models but the crack in reality we try to fill in with these constructions.
* Supplementary scientific explanation threaten to reveal themselves as fictions, so that the only contact with the real is the gap itself, the point of passage between ordinary life-world and its scientific etc. Supplements.
* The transcendental dimension implies a failed ontology, necessarily generates its own antinomies.
* We gain access to the In-itself by identifying our deficiency with the deficiency inscribed into reality itself.
    * Freud: the name of this "deficiency" in humans is sexuality.
        * It is the very elementary gesture of "civilizing" the life of a human animal.
        * Sex is the space where we confront ontological incompleteness and get caught in the endless self-reproducing loop in which the aim of desire is not its goal but the reproduction of its lack.
* How reality has to be structured to allow for enchainment of deficiencies:
    * Trans-ontological function of "*less than nothing*", a subtractive agency which makes nothing out of not-yet-something, which is to be added to the not-yet-something so that we get nothing.
    * Snout of the *Klein bottle* by means of which reality can relate to itself.
    * *Absolute*: circular turn of self-relating by means of which a movement gets caught in its own loop.
    * "Sexualization": exemption of a goal from the domain of the possible and becomes impossible-to-achieve so that satisfaction is brought by the process of repeatedly failing to achieve it.
    * What distinguishes man from animal is the rise of a new point of impossibility, *das Ding*, the impossible-real ultimate point of reference of desire.
    * Subject as such is hysterical: the hysterical subject is a subject who poses jouissance as an absolute, s/he responds to the absolute of jouissance in the form of unsatisfied desire.
        * Hysteria is the elementary "human" way of installing a point of impossibility in the guise of absolute jouissance.


# Corollary 1 Intellectual Intuition and Intellectual Archetypus: Reflexivity in Kant and Hegel
## Intellectual Intuition from Kant to Hegel

Intellectual intuition: the free flow of direct self-awareness in which freedom and necessity, activity and passivity, collide.

* Impossible in Kant, the transcendental I relies on a gap from the Real which is closed in the experience of intellectual intuition.
    * Transcendental subject is a bare consciousness which accompanies all concepts.
    * Consciousness in itself is not a representation distinguishing a particular object but a form of representation in general, representation insofar as it is to be entitled knowledge.
    * Radical gap separates the I from its noumenal support.
    * The I exists only as ex-sisting, at a distance from the "thing" that it is.
    * Irreducible crack in the edifice of Being gives space to deontological dimension of Ought (Ought fills in the incompleteness of Being).
    * Freedom persists only in a space in between the phenomenal and the noumenal: we are free only insofar as our horizon is that of the phenomenal, insofar as the noumenal domain remains inaccessible to us.
* Kantian Real is the noumenal Thing beyond phenomena, Hegelian Real is the gap itself between the phenomenal and the noumenal, the gap which sustains freedom.
    * Free act would be to know horrible consequences of choosing the evil and nonetheless to choose it. 
    * Kantian transcendental turn: distinction between how things appear to me and how things effectively appear to me.
        * Mistaking an object for a different one, what is wrong is how the object really appeared to me and not that I am unaware of how thing "really are in themselves".

Hegelian perspective: Kant remains too Spinozean, the crack-less positivity of Being is transposed onto the inaccessible In-itself.

* The Kantian gap is the solution: Being itself is incomplete.
* "One should conceive the Absolute not only as Substance but also as Subject"
* *Intellectus archetypus* (divine understanding) and *intellectus ectypus* (human understanding):
    * We should conceive the limitation of human understanding as its positive feature.
    * Reason is Understanding itself without its Beyond.
        * Reason is less than Understanding; Reason is what Understanding, in its activity, really does, in contrast to what it wants/means to do.
        * Epistemology vs ontology, illusion that its own analytic power is only an abstraction, something external to true reality which persists out there intact in its inaccessible fullness.
        * Reason is Understanding in its productive aspect.
        * Act of abstraction is the act of self-imposed blindness, of refusing to "see it all".
        * Understanding → Reason; subtract from Understanding its constitutive illusion.

## From *Intellectus Ectypus* to *Intellectus Archetypus***

Kant: determinate vs reflective judgments:
* Determinative: objective principle, certain things of nature could be produced only by a cause that follows intentions in determining itself to action
* Reflective: subjective principle, the peculiar character of my cognitive powers is such that this is the only way I can judge how those things are possible.
    * Necessary character: it is unavoidable to apply to nature the concept of intention.
    * We cannot objectively establish the existence of an intelligent original being.
* Objectivity vs subjectivity, actuality vs possibility: if reality was directly accessible, there would be no possibilities only actual objects.
    * If understanding was intuitive rather than conceptual...
    * In saying that a thing is actual, we are positing the thing itself (apart from that concept).
    * Distinction between actual and possible holds merely subjectively (for human understanding).
    * No gap between Is and Ought in intellectus archetypus

*Intellectus archetypus* vs *intellectus ectypus*: not opposition of two species of *intellectus*, but the opposition of the universal and one of its particular species, which is why we do not have to have in mind our finite *intellectus ectypus* in order to imagine the divine *intellectus archetypus*.
* Special character of our understanding requires to have the universal model in mind.
* Purposefulness is not a constitutive category of our phenomenal reality.
    * Organism enacts the first step towards overcoming the duality of reason and intuition; its empirical components are not just external contingent stuff, they are organically rooted in its Whole.
        * The universal concept "organically" engenders out of itself its parts, particularizes itself in them.
* It is enough to think the intellectus archetypus for it to perform its necessary function.
    * It has to remain a pure presupposition in order to function, the actual demonstration of its existence would be catastrophic.

Hegel: Purpose is the Notion, and immanent; not external form and abstraction different from a fundamental material but penetrating, so that all that is particular is determined by this universal itself.
* German Idealism after Kant: *Reason*; the Absolute as a speculative power which generates all content out of its own self-movement
* Kant remains caught in the crude oppositions of *Understanding*.

Kant recoiled from "the Idea of Thought, which is in itself the absolute Notion, and in itself difference, reality" into a complete philosophy of the Understanding which renounces Reason
* Sloth of Reason, liberated from every call to reflect , it can leave itself alone.
* The moment Kant gets entangled in contradictions and antinomies when thinking beyond the finite horizon of our sensuous experience, he takes them as proof that we are not dealing with things themselves, insists that there cannot be contradictions in things.

Hegel: contradictions and antinomies are the innermost features of things themselves.
* Idealism: deadlocks, reversals, movement is not just the movement of our mind grappling with the thing but something immanent to the thing itself.
* "Falling asunder" in Kant's thought; split between the Absolute in its transcendent immobility and the movement of subjective mediation which cannot attain the Absolute.
    * Power of thinking, "falling asunder", should be transposed into the Absolute itself.

# Scholium 1.1 Buddha, Kant, Husserl

Husserl: transcendental empirical content (vs Kant)
* Phenomenological epoche (reduction); wealth of experience is maintained, the way the subject relates to it changes.
* Double de-substantialization:
    * Reality: we subtract our ontological commitment on account of which we treat it as a substantial "objective" entity.
        * Reality does NOT become dream; our experience of "objective reality" is subjectivized.
    * Subject is transformed: we are reduced to the void of impassive observers perceiving reality from an external distance as a dance of phenomena.
        * Ego is split between the impassive void and the acting subject who is observed from the outside as a phenomenon in the flux of phenomena.

Metzinger: fetishistic disavowal: one can know (objective knowledge) that there is no substantial Self, but one cannot "really believe" in it, we cannot help experiencing ourselves as "selves".
* "Thought is brain" = "Spirit is a bone"
* The brain is "transparent" from the standpoint of the subject, but not from the standpoint of an outside observer.
* Buddhist "enlightenment": enlightened awareness is the direct awareness of a self-less system, a self-less knowledge.
    * "Anatman" is the only subjective stance which assumes the result of cognitivism (no self) and is fully compatible with radical scientific naturalism.
    * Ethical implication: "Zen and the sword are one and the same"; the enlightened stance in which the difference between life and death no longer matters, we are directly our act.
        * Direct, non-reflected military interpellation; *perverse desubjectivization*: the subject as such is hysterical, emerges through the questioning of the interpellating call of the Other.
        * Ultimate phenomenological attitude: I am nothing in my act, reduced to the passive observer of my acts.

Husserl: transcendental vs eidetic reduction:
* Eidetic reduction: take an empirical object and submit to it all possible variation, observing if it remains the same (essential qualities).
    * E.g. wax, its shape is not part of its essence.
    * Can be performed while I remain immersed in a naive worldly stance
    * Keeps empirical wealth of reality
        * Kant: access to the transcendental means forgetting all the data about an object and focusing on a priori universal forms and categories.
* Transcendental reduction is NOT a psychological operation, pure mental exercise, but a shattering existential experience.
    * Gap between the pure logical process of reasoning and the corresponding spiritual attitude:,
        * Pure process of reasoning; scientific starting point of the naive realist notion of things existing out there in the world, I take everything into account only in their pure appearing, the way they appear to us and are correlative to our transcendental acts.
            * Misses the attitude of Realitatsverlust: experiencing reality as a dream, de-substantialized flow of fragile and ephemeral appearances.

Both transcendental epoche and Buddhism bracket the same entity: the full-blown empirical-psychological subject who perceives itself as part of reality and an autonomous agent in it; in Husserl, this gives rise to pure subject and in Buddhism a selfless mediation, "thought without thinker". 

Three versions:
* Buddhism: selfless void
* Fichte and Schelling: direct unity of subject and object, Ego and the Divine
* Husserl: pure Ego
* Historicity: to claim that we get the same deep self-experience each time coated in a different historical wording.
    * BUT the core of the experience of withdrawing from the full immersion into reality acquires a *specific spin*.

Even if the phenomenological epoche occurs in a historically specific shape, it remains a break out towards "eternity"; instead of historicizing figures of eternity, one should historicize eternity itself.

# Scholium 1.2 Hegel's Parallax

Hegel's "Absolute Knowing", "thought without a thinker": pure activity coincides with merely registering what is before us.

* Idealism brought to extreme overlaps with "free associations": leaving understanding and explanation to another day and just taking up what is before us.
    * Deployment of the immanent logical necessity of thought, has to appear as grounded in an imponderable act of arbitrary decision: decision at the beginning, immediate decision, it is indeterminate (does not decide anything concretely)
        * NOT a choice, always-already done: the ability to choose presupposes the choice to choose.
    * Infinite judgment: the self-deployment of the immanent necessity of thought coincides with arbitrary decision.
* Arbitrariness; purging; "one should strive to become the last piece of dirt with whose removal the room will be clean."
    * Authentic philosophy is not a species of discourse but an existential decision, enactment of traversing the fantasy
        * Theoretical psychoanalysis
* Crack between the historical and the logical in Hegel (PoS and SoL), but not a clear line of distinction.
    * Each side has already passed over into the other, Moebius strip.
    * *Verschrankung*: there is no synthesis that binds them and the border that separates them is continually breached.
* Two logics:
    * SoL: subjective generation of truth
    * Encyclopedia Logic: objectification of this truth in the form of knowledge.
        * Logic as an object of transmittable knowledge.
* Overcoming opposition: radical dialectical skepticism IS the stable reporting on an acquired knowledge. Resignation to the university frame, sacrifice of "creativity", is the true sacrifice of sacrifice (sacrifice of fascination by one's creative skepticism).

# Scholium 1.3 The "Death of Truth"

Three events for the "death of truth":
\1. Fundamentalisms/political correctness: disavow rational argumentation and ruthlessly manipulate data to get their message through.
\2. Digital media; people form communities defined by specific ideological interests where they exchange news and opinions outside a unified public space.
\3. Postmodern "deconstructionism"/ historicist relativism: there is no objective truth valid for all, every truth relies on a specific horizon. (Vs liberals: facts are out there, accessible to an objective disinterested approach, freedom of opinions vs freedom of facts)
* "Data" are a vast impenetrable domain, we always approach them from a horizon of understanding, privileging some data and omitting others.
* Most efficient lies are lies which reproduce only factual data.
* Difficult thing is to show of interested standpoints are not ultimately all equally true, some describe the dynamics of a social totality more adequately.
* Subjective interests are themselves moments of social totality, formed by active or passive participants in social processes.

Difference from 'before the death of truth' is the disintegration of the one big Lie which had stronger ideological hegemony.
* "Better injustice than disorder, better one big Lie than the reality of a mixture of lies and truths".
* There is no return to the old ideological hegemony.
* Universal truth is accessible only to those who are engaged in the struggle for emancipation, not to those who try to maintain "objective" indifference.
* There are not only true and false data, there are also true and false subjective standpoints, since these standpoints themselves are part of social reality.

# Theorem II Sex as Our Brush with the Absolute

## Antinomies of Pure Sexuation

Copjec: Lacan's formulas of sexuation as antinomies of pure sexuation.
* Inconsistencies which structure sexual difference
* Kant: antinomies arise when transcendental categories are applied to reality "in itself"

Mathematical antinomies:
* Antinomy of space and time:
    * Thesis: The world has a beginning in time, is also limited as regards space.
    * Antithesis: The world has no beginning or limits in space, it is infinite as regards both time and space.
* Antinomy of atomism:
    * Thesis: every composite substance is made up of simple parts and nothing anywhere exists except the simple or what is composed of the simple.
    * Antithesis: no composite thing is made up of simple parts, and nowhere in the world does anything simple exist.
* Quantitative scope of reality in both directions.
* Concern the immanent non-all nature of reality

Dynamical antinomies:
* Antinomy of spontaneity and causal determinism:
    * Thesis: causality in accordance with laws of nature is not enough, it is necessary to assume that there is also another causality, that of spontaneity.
    * Antithesis: there is no spontaneity, only laws of nature.
* Antinomy of necessary being or not
    * Thesis: there belongs to the world a being that is absolutely necessary.
    * Antithesis: necessary being exists nowhere in the world, nor does it exist outside the world as its cause.
* Qualitative exception to reality.
![[formulas.png]]
* Masculine left side, defined by the universality of the "phallic function" and its constitutive exception.
    * Male subject confronts objet a
* Feminine right side, lack of exception
    * The non-existing woman is entirely subordinated to the phallic function and this lack of exception enables her to see the Master-Signifier as a signifier of the inconsistency/lack of the big Other.
* Not about biology, formulas of sexuation register the impasse a human being-of-language encounters when it tries to symbolize its sexuality.

Kantian antinomies signal the impossibility of grasping the Thing-in-itself, the impossible can only be circumscribed through failures as** sublime**.
* Kant: sublime is masculine, beautiful is feminine
* Lacan: sex is as such sublime, not only in its cultivated form but because failure and attachment to an impossible-real Thing are constitutive of human sexual experience.
    * Sexual difference is located in the interior of the Sublime itself, in its two modes.

Kant,** beauty vs sublime**: beauty is connected with the form of the object, having boundaries while the sublime is formless and boundless (sublime ideas of reason are called into the mind by the inadequacy of sensuous presentation).
* Mathematical sublime is occasioned by an almost ungraspably vast, formless object.
    * Reason steps in because reason has in store the idea of infinity.
* Dynamical sublime: enormously powerful natural force (e.g. storm)
    * From a safe distance, power of resistance which gives us the courage to be able to measure ourselves against the seeming omnipotence of nature.
    * Recognition of resources for heroism: although objectively we are physically subject to the power of nature, we can also act in the name of our rational principles against this narrow self-interest.
* The sublime provides a sense of that which is beyond our own self-interest, in the sublime we recognize our highest and truest freedom.

Lacan: Sade is the truth of Kant, Sade is a closet Kantian
* Acting upon one's desire can no longer be grounded in any "pathological" interests or motivations and thus meets the criteria of ethical act: 
    * "following one's desire" overlaps with "doing one's duty"
* Jouissance is, like the moral law, beyond self-interest as well as beyond the pleasure principle.
    * = death drive, non-pathological; brings pleasure but only in pain.

Mathematical sublime has no reference to higher dimension external to the sensuous, no exception to the order of the sensuous.
* Lacan: antinomy of the non-all: there is no exception to the sensuous order, but we nonetheless cannot totalize it, this order remains non-all.
* The sensuous is overcome from within, caught into its own inconsistency.
    * Jouissance feminine
* Antinomy of masculine sexuality vs that of feminine sexuality;
    * Masculine sexual economy relies on a non-sexual (e.g. ethical) exception which sustains its universality.
    * Jouissance feminine is limitless and is traversed by an immanent deadlock that may push it towards self-renunciation.
* Vs animal procreation, humans isolate a sexual act and make it a goal-in-itself, an act of the intense experience of spiritualized enjoyment.
    * Sex is the break with "natural life"
    * The tension that characterizes the Sublime is immanent to sexuality, designates its immanent antagonism, it is not a tension between sensuous sexuality and another "higher" dimension.
        * This is why sexual enjoyment is enjoyment in the failure itself, in repeating the failure.
* Sublime sexual Thing can only be circumscribed as the absent focal point of the repeated attempts to get it, negatively evoked through successive failures to reach it.

Lacan's sublime is an object elevated to the level of the thing, short circuit of an ordinary thing or act through which the impossible Real Thing transpires.
* Desublimation is easy to occur, one wrong step is enough (fragile short-circuit)
* Desublimation is not traversing the fantasy, the object only becomes part of ordinary reality.

Sexual act and the comical;
* The sexual act appears at least minimally ridiculous to those who are not directly engaged in it, discord between the intensity of the act and the indifferent calm of everyday life.


Masculine and feminine are NOT positive entities but formal structures of two types of antagonisms.
* Feminine subjectivity is hysterical questioning of the identity provided by ideological interpellation
    * E.g. MeToo
    * "You (the Master) say that I am that, but why am I what you are saying that I am?"
* Masculine subjectivity tries to arrive at its phallic symbolic identity which eludes them forever
    * "Am I really a man?"
* Sexual difference is that between two functionings of sexual difference:
    * Masculine: difference between masculine human universality and its feminine exception
    * Feminine: difference between feminine non-all and masculine no-exception.
    * Sexual difference splits from within the very universality of sex.

The transcendental is not a stable universal frame disturbed by the chaotic multiplicity of external sensations; it is cut from within, antinomic, traversed by immanent inconsistencies.
* Kant rejects ontology as general metaphysics, formal universal knowledge of reality independent of particular sensual data.
* We cannot get rid of metaphysical temptations, they are grounded in the nature of human reason, rational prescription to secure systematic unity and completeness of knowledge.
* Reason as the seat of unique error, "transcendental illusion".
    * E.g. the soul: a feature of self-consciousness (identical nature of the I of apperception) gets transmuted into a metaphysics of a self (as an object) that is "known" through reason alone to be substantial, identical etc.
    * $ → imaginary ego as an object

## Sexual Parallax and Knowledge

What is reality composed of?
* Impossibility of being One is inscribed into reality as its innermost condition of (im)possibility.
* Deontological tension inscribed into the heart of ontology: reality cannot be what it should be immanently.
* Hegel: One is only self-reflected, in contrast to its properties
    * Failure of predicated leads to "rose is a rose", repetition of the substantive.
    * Self-identity is the assertion of the difference itself (not differentiality), is grounded in a failure of predicates.
        * Objet a as "I don't know what"

How do we get from One to Two?
* Two is less than One, not two ones but the One plus a void which cuts into it as the mark of its impossibility.
    * Asymmetry of the two poles is radical: second element just fills in the void of the incompleteness of the first one.
* Barred One opens up the temptation to elevate the Other itself into the ultimate absolute ground, complex field in which every one is rooted.
    * BUT: there is no Other, the One is in itself "barred", provides no ultimate ground.

Kant → Hegel:
* Hegelian critique: antinomies are not doubled in the sense subjective antinomies "reflect" antinomies of the Thing. Our contact with the Absolute is the very subjective "distortion" so that moving beyond Kant is not "objective" dialectics but the inclusion of the subjective "distortions" into "objective" processes.
    * Redoubled distortion defines the Absolute.
* As the Absolute impossible-real Thing, sex is accessible only as the always-missed point of reference of detours and distortions.
* Lacan: sexuality inscribes itself into the cuts and gaps of the spoken word; the ambiguity sexualizes the situation.
    * Absolute is virtual (impossible point of reference of erotic games) and as such fragile: it is the ordinary reality that is hard, inert, stupidly there.

**Impossibility of One (castration)**:
* Quantum physics, the superposition of multiple versions in a wave stands for "castration".
* Instead of there being multiple versions of shadows accompanying the actual One, the One is one of the shadows contingently selected to fill in the void.
* E.g. subject: subject is barred, fails to articulate itself in the symbolic, and this failure is the subject, so subject is an outcome of its own failure to be.
    * Coincidence of opposites: I am unique singularity and simultaneously universal, equal to all others in my abstract uniqueness.
        * The subject is universal for itself, not only in itself; a subject is unique because it is self-identical in abstraction of all its particular features and this uniqueness makes it universal.
        * Coincidence between universality and singularity is immediate; it excludes all substantial content which appears to it as* its Other*.
            * Three modalities of the other:
                * Imaginary other--- semblant, fellowman who is like me and my competitor, struggle for recognition
                * Symbolic Other--- symbolic order which regulates the space of interaction between me and my semblants
                * Real other--- impenetrable abyss of the Other's desire, which can be elevated into the absolute Otherness of god.
                    * I am myself the impenetrable core that I encounter in the guise of absolute Otherness.

How to bring together universality of political rights, of market and the Otherness embodied in another collective mode of enjoyment, another way of life?
* Redoubling mystery: the Other's mystery is the mystery for the Other itself, our failure to grasp the Other echoes the Other's failure to grasp itself.
    * The universality that unites us with the Other does not reside in some shared positive feature but in the failure itself.
* Enigma of → enigma in:
    * Enigma of femininity: "what is a woman?" → "what does a woman want?"
    * The otherness of the other is the response the the subject's unconscious, his otherness to himself.
        * Racism is the claim that there is an Other (Jew) who perfectly knows what he is doing and secretly pulls the strings.
    * Judaism → Christianity; god is an enigma also in and for himself, Christ had to emerge to reveal god not only to humanity but to god himself.
    * Sexuality is an enigma for itself, "what does the other want from me?" and this enigma makes it work as sexuality.
        * Human vs animal: not only "lack" (absence of instinctual coordinates) but a lack with regard to an excess, excessive presence of traumatic enjoyment.
        * There is signification because there is an excessive, non-signifiable fascination and attachment.
* The reason why humans are fixated on solving tasks that cannot be solved is the effort to decipher the enigma of the Other's desire.
    * Non-sensical support of sense is the fundamental fantasy
        * Fantasy scene, child fantasizes a scene that would account for strangely intense fragments coming from the parents' bedroom.
            * E.g. Blue Velvet, the mask breathing is an imagined scene to account for the intense breathing that accompanies sexual activity.
    * "Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel": the subject never no longer needs a fantasy: every sense has to rely on nonsensical fantasmatic frame
        * "OK now I understand it!" = "Now I can locate it within my fantasmatic framework.
        * Sexuality is grounded in not-knowing and the lack of knowledge is filled in by fantasy (mystery which echoes the mystery in the Thing itself).
        * Infantile sexuality is neither biologically grounded nor part of symbolic norms. This excess is not sublated by adult "normal" sexuality which is always distorted, displaced:
            * What is acquired through the drives takes the place of instinctual sexuality. Infantile drives are always present in the unconscious.
    * "There is no political relationship": "the personal is political"
        * The universe of politics is by definition ontologically open, we always move in a minimal vicious cycle where a decision retroactively posits its own reasons.
        * Politics is not applied preexisting knowledge; every knowledge is partial, the struggle of both sides is the struggle about what this norm is.
        * A relationship is never guaranteed by an encompassing universal Signifier.
    * The search for the missing link around which sexuality is structured sustains the link between sexuality and knowledge.
    * All polymorphous-perverse play of partial drives takes place against the background of impossibility/antagonism.
        * In performing the act of copulation the subject experiences the impossibility and has to supplement with partial drives (kissing, slapping, squeezing).
        * In its immediate materiality, the act of copulation is vulgar repetitive movements (*s(barredA)*); viewed through the mist of fantasies, it is the summit of intense pleasures (*s1*).
* Multiplicity has to presuppose some form of One as the container of the multiple, necessarily obliterates antagonism.
    * If sex is multiple, this multiplicity has to be sustained by a One which is not in itself traversed by an antagonism.

*"Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel"*:
* NOT that masculine and feminine are two incompatible fields external to each other.
* Sexual difference is the difference "in itself", pure difference which cuts across every sexual identity.
* Centrality of masculine and feminine identities and of their heterosexual relating; the primordial tension is not between the heterosexual norm and the deviations from it, it is inscribed into the very heart of the norm itself which fails to capture the impossible Real of sexual difference.
* Never a set of opposite features: *1+1+a*, third element (transgender individuals) is the difference as such.
* Sexual difference is in excess of the differentiated terms, three sexes: masculine, feminine, and the difference itself (e.g. transgender).
    * Antagonistic (non)relationship precedes the terms it differentiates.
    * Politics: there is no objective third way. Difference "in itself" is not symbolic/differential but real-impossible.
* Difference is the universal as such, the constitutive antagonism, for which the third element (Jew, objet a) stands.
    * Third element is not empirical remainder, but the materialization of the antagonistic difference itself.
    * A transgender subject stands for this difference as such, in its traumatic Real, irreducible to any clear symbolic opposition.
    * The formula of sexual antagonism is not M/F but *MF+* (+ stands for the excessive element which transforms the symbolic opposition into the real of an antagonism).
* Biological difference acquires its meaning only through its symbolic status. I can "see" the difference but what I see is mediated by my symbolic universe.
* From same difference which cuts across every sexual identity to difference between two sexes:
    * Pure difference as antinomy is impossible, only articulates itself as immediately redoubled, two versions of the antinomy.
    * Two is not primordial ontological couple: the Other is a "reflexive determination" of the impossibility of the One, the figure of the Other is the embodiment of the impossibility of the One.
        * It is not just that man cannot form a relationship with a woman, "woman" is as such the name for this non-relationship.
* Feminine mathematical antinomy has a primacy over the "masculine" dynamical antinomy since the latter is a secondary attempt to resolve the deadlock of the mathematical antinomy, constitutes a Whole by way of excluding the One, exception, from the open field of the non-All.

## The Sexed Subject

Is subjectivity not traversed by sexual difference possible?
* Hegel's notion of subject is not sexed, even in the formal sense of the two types of Kantian antinomies.
* Antinomies and Hegel's two logics:
    * Mathematical antinomies characterize the domain of Being (quantity, quality)
    * Dynamical antinomies concern the tension between existence of appearances and its non-sensual essence/ground.
        * La femme n'existe pas: existence being sublated into the appearance of an essence, woman is not yet caught in the tension between essence and appearance.
* Hegel: substance → subject (consciousness → self-consciousness) happens when consciousness realizes that there is nothing behind the veil of appearances except what the subject itself puts there.
    * Having gone through reflection, we have gained the nothing behind appearances, positive nothing which is the void, subject itself.
    * Appearance qua appearance:
        * The supersensible comes from the world of appearance, it is the sensuous and posited as it is in truth.
        * The truth of the sensuous is to be appearance.
        * The distinction (gap) between appearance and essence has to be inscribed into appearance itself.
    * Triad:
        * Flat order of Being
        * Redoubling of Being with its hidden essence which transforms Being into Appearance of Essence
        * Realization that there is nothing behind the veil of appearances.
* Differential calculus, Mathematical infinite vs metaphysical infinite:
    * Metaphysical infinite: the limit which separates it from the finite is external to it since the negation of the finite is not part of the identity of the Absolute.
    * Mathematical infinite is the infinity of the series of finite numbers.
        * Limit is immanent to the finite, the mathematical infinite is nothing but this limit.
* Space of subjectivity, "quantitative relation solely as qualitatively determined": subject is pure tangential quality whose material support is a void of punctuality, it emerges through the self-sublation (vanishing) of the quantitative elements of its material supports.
    * Returns to a Being self-sublated in infinitesimal calculus.
* Redoubled subjectivity: "feminine" subject is the void that arises through the self-sublation of the mathematical domain of Being, "masculine" subject arises through the self-sublation of the "dynamic" tensions of the domain of Essence (logic of essence fills in the void opened by the logic of Being carried to an extreme with a figure of some substantial/essential beyond).
* *Lack of the binary signifier*:
    * One of the two primordial signifiers is "primordially repressed", its repression is constitutive of the entire field of sexual difference.
    * The only signifier of sexual difference is the masculine "phallic" signifier (S1); the feminine position is that of a lack/excess and not an identity.
    * *M+*: the division of a non-descript thing into One and its rest, excess or surplus.
    * *+ comes first* (similar to surplus-enjoyment); logical beginning, an excess emerges "out of nowhere".
        * + retroactively posits a self-identical Something with regard to which it is an excess; this positing of the One has to fail and the excess remains.
        * *M+ → MF+*: the duality is substantialized into the couple of M and F as two positive terms, but the excess remains as the third element.
* There is one sex and its remainder which positivizes the One's failure to be One.
    * Woman is not just more than man, woman as a + is the "more" itself, **encore**.
    * Short-circuit in which the external difference between a genus and its Other coincides with the internal difference, genus has to appear as one of its species.

Two versions for multiplicity:
\1. The binary signifier is primordially repressed and the chain of S2 emerges to supplement the void of this repression.
* Original fact of the couple of S1 and the Void.
\2. The primordial fact of the incompleteness of the signifying chain S2, whose void is filled by S1.
* Logic of formulas of sexuation: (1) is feminine, accounts for the explosion of the inconsistent multitude of the feminine non-All. (2) is masculine, accounts for how a multitude is totalized into an All through the exception which fills in the void.
* Feminine version comes first; it all begins not with the multiplicity of multiplicities which "is" the void but with the impossible/barred One, the One which is nothing but its own impossibility.

Asymmetry in sexual difference: man is non-woman (differential identity constituted in opposition to woman) but woman is not not-man.
* Woman's negativity is more radical than man's: the "not" emerges in its purity, not as just a determinate negation of its differential opposite.
* "Woman is not not-man" = "woman is not"
* Radical loss of loss: intransitive loss, woman is not without the object, the woman is just without: $

Is not the signifier (s1) the exception representing the subject for the series of other signifiers (s2)?

Why is there no sexually neutral universal subject? Because its two versions give body to the two antinomies of sexuation.
* *Masculine subject*, the exception somehow external to "objective" reality and whose subtraction constitutes the field of "objective" reality, is our *predominant notion* of subject.
* Feminine subject logically precedes the masculine subject. It is not organically included in reality as its part, it is what makes every reality non-All, operator of its inconsistency (negative gesture of withdrawal)
* Masculine subject completes reality through its own exception from it, subject in its feminine mode incompletes reality, it is a "less than nothing" which by way of being added to it, makes reality inconsistent.

## Plants, Animals, Humans, Posthumans

Sex is our contact with the Absolute:
* Redoubled not-knowing doesn't bring any new knowledge, it displaces our not-knowing into the object of knowledge itself.
* Absolute knowing is subjective, subjectively mediated.
    * Anti-semitism is pathological because it represses the reason why the Nazis needed anti-Semitism in order to sustain their ideological position: the only knowledge at the place of truth is the knowledge why a Nazi needs the figure to sustain his ideological edifice.
* Paradox redoubled: absolute knowing does not express the subject's inner truth, unconscious creativity.
    * Kierkegaard; genius vs apostle (Lacan: diplomat)
    * Subject of the unconscious is the witness of an "impersonal" Truth.
    * Hysterical conversion: the immediate organic body invaded by a Truth, transformed into a space/surface onto which the Truths of the unconscious are inscribed.
        * Body taken over as the medium of Trtuh.
    * Freudian unconscious: not the expression of subject's depth but a presupposition whose status is purely virtual.
        * The unconscious exists only with regard to its subject which remains empty, $ (cogito as subject of the unconscious).
        * Subject is radically separated from its unconscious which occupies and uses the subject as its apostle.

Thwartedness in nature implies the rejection of any form of "progressism", progress always a local occurrence.
* Hegel,* evolution of sexual difference*: sexual activity involves a deadlock from the very beginning, not only in sexed animals but already in vegetal kingdom.
    * Plants; indifferent difference
        * sexuality is indeterminate
        * Concentrated in a detachable and superfluous part of plant.
        * Different individuals are not of different sexes, they are not completely imbued with the principle of their opposition.
        * Need external hand of bees, contingent encounter.
    * Animals: "principle of opposition" as a sign of the animal's engagement, interest, non-indifference in itself and its other.
    * Pre-human reality is itself "exceptional," incomplete, and this ontological gap or incompleteness emerges "as such" with humanity.
        * Schelling, Benjamin, quantum physics
    * Humanity: the constitutive exception of nature appears as such
        * *Part of no-part*: as the disturbance of nature, humanity gives body to nature as such in its universality.
* Balanced, "natural" pre-human sexuality is a human retroactive projection.
    * Lacan: nature lacks something to be Nature (our Other) in the first place. There is no sexual instinct, no law inherent to sexuality which would be able to guide it.
    * Animals don't know that they don't know, humans *register *their not-knowing and are in search of knowing (infantile sexuality).
* Not-knowing passes from In-itself to For-itself, reflexive registration.
    * *Unconscious *registration, humans are unconscious of the lack of knowledge.
        * Determinate negation, infinite judgement; different from "not conscious"
    * Unconscious existence is inscribed into the symbolic order in the guise of the excess-of-enjoyment which is an object which positivizes the excess of negativity.
    * Only humans can enact the infinite judgement in which the excess becomes an object, in which non-relationship as such comes to exist.
    * Non-existence of sexual relationship → existence of a non-relationship.
    * *Jouissance* is never a pure excess of productivity over every object, it is *always an* *object*.
* Human sexuality is NOT the animal substance merely "sublated" into civilized modes and rituals, its substance itself is radically transformed.
    * Sexuality as unconditional Passion is the result of Culture.
    * Culture retroactively posits/transforms its own natural presupposition; retroactively denaturalizes nature itself (Freudian Id, libido)
* Human sexuality as weird synthesis of animal and plant: principle of opposition from animals and *embeddedness* from plants.
    * Technology as a way to get rid of embeddedness and embrace radical abyss of one's existence.
        * Symbolic life-world in which we are always-already pre-reflexively embedded.
        * Technology is a promise of liberation through terror, the subject which emerges in and through this experience is cogito, the abyss of self-relating negativity that forms the core of transcendental subjectivity.
            * Subject of the death-drive, properly in-human subject.
* Contingency is inscribed into the core of the process of insemination.
    * Panspermia; 40-80 percent of human genome may be linked to ancient viral invasions.
* Is the process open in its result?
    * Quantum real → reality → spirit: not simple progress, involves a failure. 
        * Ordinary reality emerges through the collapse of the wave function, erasure of virtual possibilities.
        * Explosion of spirit is a deadlock of animal life, human consciousness is the awareness of limitation and finitude.
    * Fourth stage?
        * Since humanity's highest achievements are rooted in our ultimate limitations, in what we experience as the obstacle to spiritual existence, the idea that the higher level can survive without the obstacle is an illusion
            * Paradox of* objet a*; disturbing obstacle which engenders the notion of perfection to which it serves as the obstacle. If we abolish the obstacle, we simultaneously lose what it is obstacle to.
        * Marx, capitalism obstacle/contradiction is the condition of impossibility of the full deployment of the productive forces, BUT simultaneously its condition of possibility: we would lose the productivity that seemed to be generated and thwarted by capitalism.
            * Marxism communism is impossible fantasy, but a fantasy inherent to capitalism itself, the capitalist inherent transgression at its purest (fantasy of maintaining productivity but losing obstacles).
        * Posthumanity: the Absolute persists as the virtual point of perfection in our finitude, when we get over the limitation we also lose the Absolute itself. In posthumanity, we will lose both mortality and creative spirituality.

Five steps in the evolution of sexuality:
\1. Asexual reproduction (**parthenogenesis**)
\2. **Plants**, sexual difference is posited in itself
\3. **Mammals**, sexual difference is posited for itself, actualized in two sexes
\4. **Humans**, natural sexuality redoubled as a fact of the symbolic order which allows for 			its instability.
\5. **Posthumanity**, both levels disintegrate, scientifically engineered asexual reproduction cancels sexuality, prospects of asexual symbolic identifications (????)

# Corollary 2 Sinuosities of Sexualized Time

Sexuality as a formal phenomenon, a certain activity is "sexualized" the moment it gets caught in a distorted circular temporality.

Time of the **death-drive** is sexualized time: immortality of a compulsion-to-repeat which persists beyond life and death.

Sadean subject is the first form of post-human sexuality, the practice of search for sexual pleasures gets desexualized; the result is a mechanized cold sexuality.

## Days of the Living Dead

Era of sexual permissiveness but it is doubly constrained:
* Tightly regulated by politically correct rules
* Necessary obverse of permissiveness is profuse depression: the only way to simply set in motion our pleasures is to introduce pain e.g. in guise of guilt.
    * Experiencing pleasure as such makes us guilty, without pleasure there is no guilt.
    * ALSO, guilt provides the surplus-pleasure which transforms a simple pleasure into intense jouissance.
    * Post-apocalyptic video games: fresh chance, the enjoyment of a chance to re-start in a simplified world thinly veiled by the apparent horror of dystopic collapse.
        * Not envisaging changes to capitalist modernity, only dreams.
        * Zero-level state stands for capitalism, specific capitalist constellation disguised as a wild state of nature.
        * Desires determined by our "big Other"
        * Brazil, restaurant photos and lumps: *separation*: we perceive the lump (real food) through the fantasy lens (of the photo).
            * Free choice (the waiter insists that the hero makes a choice between different photos for the same lump) is needed to sustain the appearance that appearance matters, that there is a substantial difference between different excremental lumps.

Lacan: the big Other in its "normal" functioning is threatened in digitalization of our daily lives.
* *"There is no big Other"*: the big Other cannot even persists as a coherent symbolic fiction since it is thwarted by immanent antagonisms and inconsistencies.
    * *The big Other is one of the names for the unconscious*: the unconscious is not an alienated substance determining the subject, it is a name for the inconsistency of Reason itself.
    * Although the speaking subject is spoken, decentered, there is no other who would function like that.
    * There is something like subject only insofar as there is no big Other: the subject cannot rely on any firm substantial support, it is caught in the abyss of its freedom.
    * There cannot be a standard which allows us to take measure of our acts and pronounce their true meaning, true ethical status.
* *"Desire is the desire of the Other"*:
    * Imaginary (mediation of my desires with others' desires)
    * Symbolic (overdetermination of my desire by the big Other)
    * Real: the subject's confrontation with the Real of the Other's desire in its abyssal impenetrability is constitutive subjectivity.
        * The subject can never be completely alienated, grounded in an external substantial entity ("it's not me, it's the unconscious big Other which determines my desires").
* *Alienation vs separation*: the big Other is already alienated from itself, separated from its real core, this separation in the heart of the big Other sustains the space for subjectivity.
    * The big Other itself is castrated.
        * The castration of the Other is excluded in *paranoia*.
* Digitalization, rise of digital networks which "know the subject better than the subject itself", *one can no longer say that "there is no big Other"*.
    * The big Other falls into reality, it is a really-existing object in reality that is programmed to regulate and control us.
        * Paranoia; the big Other becomes an actual agent that persecutes the subject.
    * BUT, our paranoia about digitally controlled is pathological even if we are totally controlled since the digital big Other is immensely stupid.
        * Machine who knows too much, unable to simplify the complexity of the situation and reduce it to its essentials.
    * Digitalization doesn't decenter the subject, it abolishes its decentering.
        * The subject's constitutive decentrement:
            * I am deprived of my most intimate "subjective" experience, fundamental fantasy is out of reach, I can never consciously experience it and assume it.
        * The ultimate aim of psychoanalysis is the deprive the subject of the fundamental fantasy that regulates the universe of his self-experiencing.
            * Subject of the unconscious emerges only when a key aspect of the subject's fundamental fantasy becomes inaccessible to him, is primordially repressed.
            * The unconscious is the inaccessible phenomenon, not the objective mechanism that regulates my phenomenal experience.
            * Gap between fantasmatic self-experience and external behavior: fantasy, at its most elementary, becomes inaccessible to the subject: its inaccessibility makes the subject "empty".
                * Impossible relationship between the empty non-phenomenal subject and the phenomena that remain inaccessible to the subject.
* What digitalization threatens is not autonomous human subjectivity but the decentered Freudian subject.
    * Can the digital Other "swallow" the symbolic big Other (e.g. can it fail to do X in the right way, so that its failures evoke the contours of what they fail to touch?)
    * *Counterfactuals*; ultimate difference between digital universe and the symbolic space proper.
        * Difference between coffee without milk and coffee without cream is virtual.
            * Unconscious: is like "milk" in "coffee without milk".
        * Difference between the "unconscious" (neuronal, social, etc.) facts that determine us and the Freudian "unconscious" whose status is purely counterfactual.
            * Counterfactual works only with subjectivity, every signifying structure implies a subject.
            * In order to register the difference between "plain coffee" and "coffee without milk", a subject has to be operative.
    * Video games interpellate the gamer into a specific mode of subjectivity, pre-Oedipal, not-yet-castrated subjectivity that floats in a kind of obscene immortality.
        * BUT, liberation from bodily constraints (real live environs etc.) is the castrative move at its most elementary.
        * Continuity of cyberspace with the *Oedipal mode of subjectivization*:
            * Intervening Third Order which sustains the subject's desire while simultaneously acting as the agent of Prohibition.
            * Actual functioning of cyberspace continues to rely on the elementary dispositif of the symbolic Law.
            * INTER-FACE = my relationship to the Other is never FACE-TO-FACE, always the interposed digital machinery which stand for the "big Other" as the anonymous symbolic order whose structure is that of a labyrinth.
                * *Cyberspace sublime*: magnitude of messages and their circuits which my synthetic imagination cannot comprehend.
            * There is no "Other of the Other"; the virtual universe is a priori inconsistent, with no last guarantee of its coherent functioning.
            * Everything is possible in cyberspace for the price of assuming a fundamental impossibility; you cannot circumvent the mediation of the interface which separates you as the subject of enunciation from your symbolic stand-in.
            * The resolution of the "Oedipus complex" covers up the wound of castration by way of "territorializing" me again, allocating me in a place in the symbolic universe provided by the name-of-the-Father.
                * Wagner, *Parsifal*, the wound is only healed by the spear that smote you.
                * Oedipus names the wound as well as the attempt to heal it.
                * "Pre-Oedipal" space is sustained by and reacts to something that comes after it.
        * Axiom of the philosophy of finitude: one cannot escape finitude/mortality as the unsurpassable horizon of experience.
            * Lacan: no matter how much one tries, one cannot escape immortality.
                * E.g. the immortality in the intuition of something indestructible in a truly radical Evil.
                * "Immortality of the death drive is not a biological fact but a psychic stance of "persisting beyond life and death", readiness to go on beyond the limits of life.
                    * Jouissance, excessive enjoyment.
                * It is only through the intervention of jouissance that a human animal becomes properly mortal, relating to the prospect of its own extinction.
            * *Parallax:* the undead Thing is the remainder of castration, generated by castration. Castration itself is sustained by the immortal excess which eludes it.
                * Castration and excess are the same entity inscribed onto the two surfaces of a Möbius strip.
        * *Unity of limitation and immortality*: entity finds peace in fitting its finite contours, what pushes it beyond its finite form is the fact that it cannot achieve it, that it is marked by an irreducible impossibility, on behalf of this immanent and constitutive obstacle, a thing persists beyond its "death".
            * Modernity, specific form of the negation of negation: every negation, effort to reach the bottom, zero-point fails.
                * E.g. social life, most of us fail to achieve social success and slide towards some form of proletarization, we even fail this tendency to become proletarians who have nothing to lose but their chains, and somehow maintain a minimum of social status.
                * Downward negation of negation: Western radical Leftists desperately search for substitute proletariat (nomadic immigrants).
                    * Problem of how to go on when the game is over.
                    * Hegel is also the thinker of the void of inertia after "the system is closed".
        * Multiplicity of immortalities:
            * Badiouian noble immortality/infinity of the deployment of an Event.
            * Sadean fundamental fantasy of another ethereal body of the victim which retains its beauty after being tortured indefinitely.
                * Comical and disgustingly terrifying are inextricably connected.
                * Denial of castration, of the gap of the Real that hollows external reality itself: being fully immersed into gaming dream space is structurally the same as the idea of being fully immersed into external reality as one of the objects in it.
                    * Immersion into the digital space can be experienced in the two opposite ways of free floating and of total control.

## Cracks in Circular Time

The "undead" dreamspace of video games breaks with linear time and throws us into a circular time, we can return to the same point and begin again.

* *The Discovery*: *repetition* is not a process of playfully re-enacting the past but the activity set in motion by an ethical failure.
* *Arrival*: paradoxes arise when human sequential mode of awareness is confronted with a holistic circular one.
    * Notion of acting, commonplace opposition between free choice and determinism is left behind.
    * The motives of the heptapods coincide with history's purposes, they act to enact chronology.
    * Louise's act:
        * The subject doesn't have the choice of directly selecting its future, more subtle possibility of breaking out of the circle of future and past.
        * Willing the inevitable is not just empty gesture which changes nothing: it is necessary in its superfluity--- if we don't do it, the entire frame which makes the act inevitable falls apart and an ontological catastrophe occurs.
    * Free will and choice exists if one chooses to do nothing.
    * A true choice is the choice of no-choice, I realize that *I don't really have a choice*.
    * A decision breaks the circle of time; heptapods need us, their holistic approach is also flawed: ellipse is the basic form of their "language": it circulates around a disavowed cut which always-already ruins its perfection.
        * There is predestination, we cannot change the future, but we can change the past.
        * Inconsistency can emerge only in a sexualized universe of finite and temporal beings: our "Fall" from the infinite atemporal present to a succession of moments in time is in some way superior to the holistic eternal Present, it opens new dimensions of freedom.
    * Ontological cheating, not putting the cube on the platform, the cube remains but the reality collapses:
        * Ideological commitment: what if I cannot return the cube to its place, claim that what I offer is Communism?
            * Stalism, Khmer Rouge: Communism remains, but social reality is in ruins, caught in the vortex of self-destruction.
            * Even if I try to pretend "this was not really Communism", the cube will be there.
        * Ontological catastrophe, disintegration of reality; occurs if the key element whose dislocation opens up and sustains the space of reality returns to its "proper" place, when the deontological tension that defines reality is overcome.

# Scholium 2.1 Schematism in Kant, Hegel... and Sex

Transcendental schema is the procedural rule by which a category or pure, non-empirical concept is associated with a sense impression.
* Private, subjective intuition is discursively thought to be a representation of an object.
* Schemata connect empirical concepts with the perceptions from which they were derived.
* Möbius strip reversal of subjective into objective through subjective intervention.
    * It is through the intervention of transcendental categories mediated by schematism that the confused subjective mixture of perceptions becomes a representation of "objective reality".
* Schematism is grounded in the subject's finitude.
* Lacan's sexual schematism:
    * Universal fact of no sexual relationship
    * Schemata is unique, individual fantasy invention to render a sexual relation possible
    * Fantasy constitutes desire, provides coordinates
        * E.g. desiring a strawberry cake, *how do I know that I desire a strawberry cake in the first place?*
* Ideological scheme: a figure which mediates between general ideological propositions and concrete subject's experiences.
    * Media messages us into accepting the neo-conservative fiscal message/concept by attaching it to a specific pseudo-concrete image.
        * E.g. "unemployed single mother" in John Major's Conservative leadership in 1980s.
        * The message has to be sustained by a specific fantasy
    * Which agent stands for the totality of struggle as its exemplary case is never a neutral fact.
* Language in general vs human language in particular
    * There is no actually-existing language other than human language but in order to comprehend this "particular" language, one has to introduce a minimal difference, conceiving it with regard to the gap which separates it from language "as such" (pure structure of language deprived of insignia of human finitude, erotic passions and mortality etc.)
* Schemata as mediator, third element of a dialectical triad, a medium through which the two opposed poles only exist.
    * E.g. God/man → Christ
    * Public law becomes actual only when it is schematized by its "oppositional determination", set of unwritten rules which regulate its actual use.
    * The universal can effectively mediate its content only when it is redoubled in itself, supplemented by its particular counterpart.
    * The only true infinity is that of the mediator itself, the task is to transpose finitude into the Thing (Absolute) itself.

# Scholium 2.2 Marx, Brecht, and Sexual Contracts

Möbius** strip reversal in "incels": incel is the symptomatic point of the logic of hierarchy; point at which white supremacist partisans of hierarchy begin to use the language of the most brutal "Communism of women" and demand their just redistribution by the authorities.
* Jordan Peterson; promoting enforced monogamy
* The Left should fight for its own *Möbius *strip reversal; the domain of sexuality should remain "unjust", resisting the egalitarian logic of human rights.
    * Ultimate incompatibility of sexuality and human rights

Sexual contract, verbal consent:
* Marx's insight into hoe a formally "free" contract can also rely on coercion and effectively function as a form of coercion; "free" contract between a capitalist and a worker.
    * After the contract, one emerges to the front as capitalist and the other follows as his laborer.
* In sexual exchange, the form of free contract can conceal coercion and violence.
* Enjoyment introduces asymmetry, surplus into the balance of the exchange of pleasures
* Labor/capital exchange, worker sells his own labor power as a commodity; the commodity-form becomes universal only when an exceptional commodity appears on the market which is the productive labor-force itself.
    * Homology between surplus-value and surplus-enjoyment produced by the activity of giving pleasure, symmetry of each partner giving pleasure to the other is also always-already broken.
* Marriage is permanent contract.
    * Kant; marriage is contract where partners are not reduced to objects.
* Liberating aspect of commodification of human capacity for sex, it negates the spiritual values in which marriage as a religious institution is enshrouded, it also advances the position of women and gives them rights comparable to those enjoyed by men.
    * *Möbius* strip reversal: the only way to reach emancipation is to progress to the end of the path of commodification, of turning oneself into commodity--- a free subject emerges only as the remainder of this self-objectivization.
* Milner: difference between objective and *structural weakness*
    * Labor contract: there is exploitation since the worker is a commodity which produces surplus-value.
        * The worker is in a weaker structural position even if it is "objectively" stronger, with more empirical social power.
    * Sexual contract: women are in a structurally weaker position, even if they are socially or financially stronger.
        * MeToo; unspoken presupposition that the sexual act is ultimately as such an act of rape, of violent imposition and coercion; partisans treat men exclusively as potential rapists and women as potential victims of male power.
    * MeToo vs Trump:
        * MeToo privileges structural weakness at the expense of objective weakness.
        * Trump ignores structural weakness and focuses exclusively on objective weakness and power.
            * Politics as immoral game of power.
            * Trump is the Weinstein of the US politics.
    * The exclusive focus on structural weakness in MeToo enables it to play its own power game, using it as a means of its own empowerment.
        * The objective strength of the accuser and the problematic nature of her accusations are dismissed as ultimately irrelevant.
        * The accuser's position of structural weakness gives her the power and the structural position of the accused as a white male effectively makes him powerless.
    * Power games masked as a noble struggle of victims against oppression; they reduce sex to a power game and exclude from their position of enunciation precisely sex.
        * Goal to keep men under threat; be careful what you do, we can destroy you at any moment even if you think you did nothing wrong.
        * Spirit of revenge, not of healing.
        * MeToo partisans rarely talk about sex, there is no space for love.
    * "Guilty until proven innocent".
    * "Don't bother with facts, you are a priori guilty, so repent and maybe you have a chance, since we can easily destroy you if we want!"
# Scholium 2.3 The Hegelian Repetition

Minimal form of the Möbius strip in Hegel's theory of repetition: a term intersects with its opposite through its mere repetition (tautology).

* Formula of love; coincidence of empirical person with the sublime object of love: "you are ... you!"
* "The law is the law"; law is fundamentally grounded on illegal violence.
* A "high" notion encounters itself at its lowest, as the obscene double which sustains the "high" notion.
* Opposite case; repetition causes idealization, sublation of a term to its higher level.
    * *Möbius strip of contingency and necessity*: a historical event is a contingent occurrence in its first form of appearance and it is only through its repetition that the inner notional necessity is asserted.
        * E.g. Julius Caesar, 
            * repetition brings him back as universal title
            * Triumph in death
        * Napoleon,
            * Repetition means his defeat was not just an accident
            * Survives both defeats as a contingent person, as non-entity
        * BUT, alternative versions of the past which persist in a spectral form constitute the ontological "openness" of the historical process
            * Does NOT mean that repetition means going back to the open moment of decision to make the right choice (!Benjamin).
        * First choice is necessarily the wrong one: the right choice is only possible the second time: the first, wrong choice creates the conditions for the right choice.
            * Retroactive illusion that we might have made the right choice already the first time.
            * *Möbius strip of error and truth*: by progressing on the side of the error, we may find ourselves on the side of truth.
* Concrete universality is the mediation between universal symbolic form and its contingent particular content.
    * Short-circuit, genus appears as one of its own species as opposed to others, entering a negative relationship with them.
    * Universality which includes itself among its species, in the guise of a singular moment lacking particular content (rabble).
    * Rabble cannot be abolished without radically transforming the entire social edifice.
    * Hegel's move beyond Kant is that transcendental form is mediated by its particular content and not an a priori frame.

# Scholium 2.4 Seven Deadly Sins

Seven deadly sins all opposed to some virtue.

Sins vs Decalogue: legalistic prohibition of external acts → inner attitudes that cause external evil.
* Ego in its relationship to itself: lust gluttony anger, explosion of the lack of self-control
* Ego in its relation to its object of desire, reflexive internalization of the first three:
    * *pride* of having it --- *lust* of consuming it, 
    * *avarice* to get hold of it --- *gluttony* of swallowing it, 
    * *envy* towards the other who has it --- *anger* at the Other who has it
* *Sloth* as zero-level, assertion of the gap towards the object of desire, secretly structured into three:
    * *Melancholic* sadness of not having it
    * *Acedia*, despair at not being able to get hold of it
        * Not simple laziness but desperate resignation: "I want the object, not the way to reach it. I resign to the gap between desire and its object."
        * Betrays desire; "céder sur son désir"
    * *Laziness*, indifference towards those who have it
        * "I know what is my duty, but I cannot bring myself to do it, I don't care"
* Sloth historicized:
    * Melancholy before modernity (resisting the proper pursuit of Good)
    * Simple laziness with capitalism (resisting the work ethic)
    * Depression in post- society (resisting enjoyment of life, to be happy in consumption)
* Lacan: between acedia and suicide, the second is ethical.

# Theorem III The Three Unorientables

Hegel's dialectics is not a smooth-running logical machine, it is a chain of failures, deadlocks at each point trying to reverse a defeat into a way out by stepping out and changing the coordinates.

* Enchainment of failures characterizes reality itself:* things ex-sist*, their condition of impossibility (obstacle which prevents full actualization of potentials) is their condition of possibility
    * *Concrete universality*: name of a tension/antagonism/gap, its particular forms are the ultimately failed attempts to resolve its constitutive deadlock.
* *Two divides into one*: the external opposition of two complementary poles is transposed into the immanent contradiction of the One.
* *One unites into two*: conservative move to resolve the self-division of the One by positing the two poles as the opposed poles of some higher unity.
    * E.g. harmony between the two sexes replaces the immanent rupture of sexuality.
* Twisted structure due to a subject which is its own impossibility; the failure of representation IS the subject.
    * Abyssal circularity in which the search itself creates what it is looking for, Spirit "finds itself". The becoming does not appeal to substantial/underlying self, or to successor substantial selves.
    * E.g. catastrophe (war, ecological...) is already in how we deal with its threat.
    * The Self to which Spirit returns is produced in the moment of this return.
    * The end reveals its priority (that it was equally the First) by the fact that nothing emerges which was not already there.
    * Double self-enclosure; circularity re-marked in another circular mark
        * If the circular closure has to be re-asserted as closure in order to be fully actual, in itself it is not yet truly a closure. It is only the contingent excess of its repetition which makes it a closure.
        * Redoubling points towards the abyss of impossibility; a thing becomes what it is by way of trying to catch up with itself, to overcome its constitutive impossibility.

Being---Essence---Notion, Möbius strip---Cross-cap---Klein bottle:
* *Möbius strip*: basic dynamics of the order of being
    * Coincidence of opposites
    * No proper difference/identity
    * Cut is implied, the shape results from a cut, although it has no simple outside.
    * Effort to mediate the two opposite poles by determining their difference fails again and again.
    * *Quilting point*: the point when an element encounters itself on the opposite side, when signifier falls into the signified.
* *Cross-cap*: pure/impossible difference that separates the two strips
    * No shared space between the two sexes or classes, what holds the social space/space of sexuality together is antagonism itself.
    * *Quilting line*: the line holding two halves of cross-cap, making them impossible to bring together into a Whole.
* *Klein bottle*
    * If X falls into the central hole, it comes back as part of the very body that surrounds this hole (subject returns from the outside as the very round body in the midst of which the hole is gaping.
    * Convolution impossible in three-dimensional reality.
    * *Quilting tube*

## Möbius Strip, or, the Convolutions of Concrete Universality

*Coincidence of the opposites***:
* NOT permanent struggle of the opposing tendencies.
    * E.g. Mao's dialectics
* NOT negative-theological overlap in the absolute One
* Twisted space in which a line intersects with its opposite
* Fascism:
    * Politics reaches its peak in a gesture of self-denial, presenting oneself as a-political.
    * In Fascism, political division reaches self-relating, it coincides with the division between politics and a-politics;
        * Genus of politics encounters itself in its oppositional determination.
* Anti-communism: 
    * first they say the October Revolution was Jewish plot then "Communism is antisemitic".
    * Inconsistencies of anti-communism, also conservative turn in 1930s Soviets
* Anti-semitism:
    * 1. Jews promote multiculturalism, weakening of national identities, sustained by the exception of the Jews themselves.
    * 2. BUT the antagonism between multi- and mono-culturalism cuts across all societies, Jews included
        * Jews are losing their position of exception
        * We have Zionists and those Jews who put in doubt the Jewish exclusive national identity
    * 1 → 2, formulas of sexuation.
* **Negation of negation**:
    * E.g. in psychoanalysis;
        * First, external contingency is revealed as a moment of the subject's inner fate, a "reified expression of the turmoil of his/her inner life.
            * Traditional idealist position, even if we emphasize the remainder which always resists symbolization.
            * Material position: process is not endless progression towards the ideal of complete symbolization, *we fall back into contingency*:
        * Then, key moment of psychoanalytic treatment is the isolation of a traumatic encounter which triggered the formation of a symbolic "pearl".
            * Symbolization has to be concluded to function as a symbolic fact, this conclusion can only be provided by a piece of raw contingent real.
            * The "quilting point" throws us back to the beginning, its an element of contingent Real.
* **"Signifier falls into the signified"**
    * Symbolic space "big Other" is structured as a Möbius strip: Language as a whole has to turn in an abyssal circle, lacking a positive ground.
    * Lack of external fundament is constitutive of language; the external limit of language is also its internal limit making language itself incomplete, never able to achieve full self-identity as an instrument of communication.
    * Because of this incompleteness, signifier and signified can never fully correspond to each other, signified always slides beneath the signifier, eludes it.
    * Language creates the illusion of semantic closure by a* "quilting point" at which signifier falls into signified*.
    * *Name*:
        * Divides the subject between the void of its cogito and the symbolic features which identify it in/for the big Other (the signifier which represents it for other signifiers)
        * The name is included in the object it designates; the signifier has to intervene IN the signified to enact the unity of meaning.
            * The name unites a multitude of properties into a single object.
            * E.g. Jaws, Socialism, Jew
        * The name is a *symptom* of a thing it names: it is a signifier which falls into the signified, it stands for *objet a*, the X which makes a thing a thing.
        * Every name is a *Vorstellungs-Reprasentanz*: representative stand-in of a missing representation, of that dimension in the designated object which eludes representation.
* **How are Master-Signifier and objet a related?**
    * Passage from S1 to S(barredA) is shift in perspective which renders palpable the obfuscating function of the Master-Signifier.
    * Objet a is coalesced with the signifying function in Master-Signifier.
    * S1 changes into S(barredA) when objet a is *subtracted* from the signifying space, when S1 and objet a are *separated*.
        * *Separation*: S1 appears impotent and miserable, as a mere filler of the lack.
    * Objet a is a virtual/fictive entity which always adds itself to the series of actual/necessary entities.
        * Emerges as the remainder of castration, an object which fills in the lack opened up by castration, lack itself acquiring a positive form.
    * Objet a is on the side of the signifier, while the Master-Signifier is the "quilting point" between the signifier and the signified, the point at which the signifier falls into the signified.

## The "Inner Eight"

The two surfaces/levels of the Möbius strip turn around and replicate themselves at their point of intersection.
* E.g. power and its subjects:
    * Dupuy: social space is divided into higher and lower hierarchical levels but *within the lower level, the lower is higher than the higher*.
    * Christianity:
        * Within the secular order of the state, the state is above the church. If the church wants to directly rule as also as a secular power, it reduces itself to just another secular power using religious teaching as the ideology to justify its secular rule.
        * Negative self-relationship between the universal and the particular, "*oppositional determination*": church is encompassing unity of all human lives, but encounters itself as a subordinate element of the terrestrial state power which is in principle subordinated to it; the church as social institution has to obey laws.
            * *Overdetermination*: Through this loop, the "higher" good dominates the "lower" evil: although it is the secular power which immediately plays the determining role, this role is itself over-determined by the religious/sacred All.
* Two readings of the complex self-relating entwinement of the "higher" and the "lower":
    * Idealist reading:
        * *Pharmakon*: higher all-embracing All makes the lower serve the higher goal.
        * E.g. cunning of reason, historical progress, invisible hand of the market
    * Materialist reading:
        * The difference between good and evil is inherent to evil, good is universalized evil.
        * Evil controls itself by generating a specter of transcendent good but can only do this by superseding its "ordinary" mode of evil in absolutized evil.
        * *Reconciliation *means that one should reconcile oneself with destructive negativity in all its guises as the unsublatable background of our existence and all its creative achievements.
        * *ALSO*, the loss of the One comes before the One, every spectral figure of the One fills in the void of its absence.
            * E.g. *Tannhäuser *(Castellucci, 2017), the ugly mound of the Real and the fantasy frame with slim girls hanging in the air above it.
                * Separation: split between the ghost-like substanceless appearance and the raw stuff of the realm.
                * Psychotic split: the foreclosure of the symbolic, split between Real and Imaginary.
                    * Fantasy is both images, it functions to obfuscate the fact that sex is always-already "barred", thwarted by impossibility.
* The gap that allows the reversal of lower and higher is crucial for the functioning of power, higher priesthood could be read as a necessary illusion of power.
* *Perversion*: insufficiency of the logic of transgression.
    * Repression is strongest (e.g. late-capitalist reality in which total permissiveness causes anxiety and impotence or frigidity instead of liberation)
    * Distinction between the content and form of repression: the form of repression remains operative even after the content is no longer repressed.
        * Freud's patient's unclear, muddied dream; baby daddy not certain.
        * Dialectical gap between form and content: formal procedure marks/signals the part of content that is excluded from the explicit narrative line.
            * Reconstructing "all" of the narrative content includes formal features which act as the stand-in for the "repressed" aspect of the content.
            * Content is also ultimately nothing but the indication of the incompleteness of the form, its "abstract" character.
            * E.g. melodramas, emotional excess finds its outlet in sentimental music or in other formal features.
                * Vs. Breaking the Waves, excess is located in the content.
            * The gap is to be reflected back into content itself, as an indication that this content is not all, that something was excluded from it.
                * Primordial repression: the exclusion which establishes the form itself, no matter how much we bring out the content, the gap of primordial repression persists.
* Pointing towards *cross-cap*:
    * 1. *Matter* which resists its form in its impenetrable density is an effect of the incomplete/failed formalization.
    * 2. *Form* in its distance to matter is not just an expression of matter but emerges to fill a hole in the texture of matter.
    * 1 and 2 are not symmetrical: formulas of sexuation
        * 1. *Matter* emerges to fill in the void of the non-all of form (form is non-all)
        * 2. *Form* is an exception which provides the frame for matter (matter is universal with the exception of form)
    * Kant is not formalist enough: his determinations of empty form as transcendentally and transhistorically given are filled with fixed content (a priori of transcendental categories)
    * Negativity as *pure form* has to be conceived as* inherent to substance*, as its own void.
    * Cross-cap: radical antagonism between two spaces with no common denominator.

## Suture Redoubled

Redoubling, repeating the Möbius strip gives the cross-cap.
* Signifier-signified, the spaces of both are twisted around a central abyss
* Hegel, dialectic of essence and appearance, necessary redoubling:
    * First, essence itself has to appear as an appearance that stands for the beyond of appearances.
        * E.g. Marx; value as the universal "essence" of commodities has to appear as a special commodity opposed to all other commodities.
        * E.g. monarch
        * Essence is nothing but a gap that separates appearance from itself.
    * Second, the gap that separates essence from appearance has to be reflected back into essence itself as its inner split: essence appears because it is incomplete.
        * Appearance is the return of what is repressed in/from the essence itself.
        * Appearance is nothing a gap that separates essence from itself.
* *Suture*:
    * The "inside" has to be sutured by an additional element which holds within the signifying order the place of what is excluded from it, while external reality itself has to be sutured by an element which holds in it the place of the symbolic process (*objet a*).
    * Proper name covers the lack, functions as a displacement, jump.
        * Quilting point: operates so that all descriptions attributed to the name's bearer makes sense or provides an illusion of a meaningful entity.
        * *Master-Signifier*, simultaneously opens up a void and creates the illusion of filling it in.
    * External reality has to be supplemented by a subjective element: the subjective act of transcendental synthesis transforms sensual impressions into "objective reality". 
        * Quantum physics: the collapse of the waves in the act of perception fixes quantum oscillations into single objective reality.
            * The notion of "objective" things is subjective, depends on perception, while wave-oscillations are more "objective" than perception.
    * In the symbolic order, a thing only becomes a thing when we add a name to it.
    * Fiction itself appears as part of reality, as its suturing element.
    * Two versions of suturing are both true:
        * 1. Lack is located inside, in the scene of representation, inability to completely represent its production process.
        * 2. Lack is located outside, in external reality itself.
    * Only with 2 does subjectivity proper emerge, subjectivity as inscribed into the order of things.
        * 1 reduces subjectivity effect of misrecognition
    * 1 → 2, 
        * imaginary subjectivity → symbolic subject
        * Materialism → dialectical materialism
            * 1. "No interior without exterior": Metaphysics is illusion that the circle of representation can close upon itself, blind to how the exterior is inscribed in the interior
            * 2. "No exterior without interior", *objet a* as the subjective element constitutive of objective-external reality.
    * Master-Signifier is the "subjective" signifying structure which sustains the very "objective" symbolic structure
    * Suture comes first; the gap, self-referentially, is already operative in the productive presence itself.
* Confusing the signified with reality external to it?
    * NO: for external reality to acquire its minimal ontological consistency, a signifying gesture has to intervene.

## Cross-Capping Class Struggle

"Class struggle", politico-ideological struggle is inscribed in the heart of the economic process.
* "Commodity fetishism", illusion which sustains reality.


The One is not secondary totalization of the primordially dispersed inconsistent field of productivity; it introduces inconsistency proper.
* The One is the signifier of self-division: by way of remarking the pre-existing real, the One divides it from itself, introduces its non-coincidence with itself.
* The name for this self-division of society is class struggle, subjectivity emerges from this self-division.

Class struggle cannot be reduced to a conflict between particular agents within social reality, it is an antagonism which constitutes these agents.
* Thinking the two dimensions together: transcendental logic of commodity as a mode of functioning of the social totality, and class struggle as the antagonism that cuts across social reality, as its point of subjectivization.


Objective listing of classes has to be cut short with brutal intervention of subjectivity; class-belonging is never a purely objective social fact, but is always also the result of struggle and subjective engagement.
* 1928-33 Soviets, division of peasants into categories: "Subkulak", a peasant who was too poor to be considered a proper kulak, nonetheless shared the kulak's "counter-revolutionary" attitude.
* With subkulak, the art of identifying a kulak was no longer a matter of objective social analysis.
* Subkulak designates the point at which objective social analysis breaks down and social political attitude directly inscribes itself into the "objective" order.
    * The point of subjectivization of the "objective" chain.
    * Names political division as such, the excessive element that traverses all classes, the outgrowth which has to be eliminated.

"Suture" is the point of subjectivization which guarantees the consistency of the "objective" field itself.
* Division into species and excremental leftover, "part of no-part."
* Excremental leftover functions as a direct stand-in for the Universal.

"Class struggle" is a division that cuts across the entire social space in a diagonal way.
* Christianity's all-inclusive attitude involves exclusion of those who do not accept being included in the Christian community.
    * There is a place for others in other religions, Christian universalism tendentially excludes non-believers from the universality of humankind.
    * Christian universality of all those who are excluded, "indivisible remainder" of all classificatory divisions.
* Jameson: dialectical analysis includes its own point of suspension; class struggle is the point of failure of an endless complex analysis, gesture of jumping-ahead.
    * Failure of analysis is immanent to reality itself.
    * Class struggle is a pseudo-totalization when totalization proper fails, desperate attempt to use the antagonism itself as the principle of totalization.
* Redoubling the quilting point: in a social edifice, the point that sutures it has a double face, at the top (king, leader) and the excess at its bottom (rabble).
    * Hegel failed to notice how the rabble as the destructive excess of social totality is the reflexive determination of the totality as such, immanent embodiment of its universality.
    * If he had seen the universal dimension of the rabble, the would have invented the symptom as did Marx.
        * Necessarily produced "irrational" excess of the modern rational sate; exemplify the category of singular universality.
        * Symptom as a symptom of normality:
            * E.g. hysterical symptom indicates that there is something wrong in the basic constitution of the subject whose symptom it is.
* Normality is as such a symptom: symptom formation that covers up an antagonism in the core of the psychic apparatus.
    * Normality is always a way to combine antagonistic forces into a precarious balance which allows me to survive in my society.

## From Cross-Cap to Klein Bottle

Cross-cap: two levels sutured with a quilting line, but the gap is not between Two, it is only One and its remainder/excess, asymmetry between levels.

LGBTQ+;
* Lacan: we must pass from x as the sign of an infinite ethical task to the ontological deadlock.
    * Zupancic: minimal formula of sexual difference is M+
        * + stands for subjectivity itself as the questioning of every identity.
    * Much of transgender ideology is permeated by the "masculine" obsessional urge to impose a new classification of gender identities.
* Nominalism versus realism;
    * Nominalist: + is a sign of excess of reality which we cannot grasp with our conceptual frames. There is no universality, there are only always- incomplete lists of particulars.
    * Realist (dialectical materialist): + is not just a sign of epistemological limitation but a positive entity in itself, entity which gives body to the negativity that characterizes every universality.
        * E.g. objet a and contingent objects of desire: objet a is the surplus (of the "something" that we aim in our desire that is more than all empirical objects) reflexively conceived as a particular object.
            * Non-object in the guise of an additional object.
* No amount of classificatory diversification and multiplication can save us from the antagonistic tension as it is constitutive of the sexual as such.
    * Multiplication functions as the disavowal of the antagonism; *fetishistic disavowal*.
    * Dialectical relationship between the Universal and the Particular: the difference is on the side of the Universal.
    * The Universal names the site of a Problem-Deadlock and the Particulars are the attempted but failed Answers to this Problem.
        * E.g. State as a problem, particular forms are attempt at solving it
        * E.g. sexual difference, all forms are a reaction to the antagonism, not imperfect actualizations of an ideal form.
* + does not stand for the not-yet-identified species of sexuality but for difference as such.
    * M stands for specific/particular identity
    * + is rabble, with regard to sexuality, *+ is woman*.

Three problems with "another sign that acknowledges a refusal of names... square bracket for identity in non-identity:
* Antagonistic enemy today is not "patriarchal capitalism"; the opposition between patriarchy and assertion of multiple sexual positions is strictly immanent to today's global capitalism. It is the assertion of fluidity which is hegemonic, patriarchal reaction is secondary to it.
    * True representatives of global capitalism are figures like Tim Cook who fully support LGBTQ+.
* "There is no sexual relationship": the idea of striving for a situation without structural inhibition to free expression of sexuality ignores antagonisms and inhibitions constitutive of human sexuality.
* The LGBT+ stance involves **its own counter-normativity**; those refusing identity re perceived as ethico-politically superior to those following the standard heterosexual normativity.
    * The reference to the position of enunciation does not make MeToo and LGBT+ statements automatically authentic; new subject that emerges can also be ideologically distorted, haunted by moralist self-victimization or by aggressive rage that masks the antagonisms which cut across its fractured identity.

## Snout in Plato's Cave

Predominant view of reality, openness towards the world, we are always-already in the world.
* Heideggerian question of how to reach beyond representations into reality itself is wrong.
* Convoluted space: if we go deep into "inside" our Self, we again find ourselves in the immanent outside of neural processes.
    * Paradox: I only "am" a Self at a distance from both outside reality and from my innermost side.
    * Self as a fragile screen, thin surface separating the two outsides of external reality and that of the real.

Plato's cave:
* Lacanian twist: within the cave, the Real outside the cave can only appear as a shadow of a shadow, as a gap between different modes or domains of shadows.
    * Irreducibility of the appearance to its substantial support, appearance's autonomy engenders a Thing of its own, the *true "real Thing"*.
* Process of emancipation, freedom and servitude:
    * The prisoner has to be forced out by the true master who only affirms that "I can do this" without telling me what this is and without telling me too much of who I am.
    * Authentic master is indifferent to your predicament, the smile on his face is directed not at you but at the universal Cause that motivates him.
    * The prisoner has to volunteer to be forced out (similar to analysand who volunteers the analyst as his master).
    * Dialectics of master and volunteers:
        * Master constitutes the volunteers as volunteers such that the master ultimately becomes superfluous for a certain time, afterwards one has to repeat this process.
    * Capitalism relies on structurally "voluntary" labor.
    * Different understandings of the volunteer, different forms:
        * As soon as the slave identifies himself as a slave he is no longer a slave
            * We accept voluntary servitude as serving a cause and not just ourselves.
            * I am free when I "feel as a slave", feeling of being enslaved bears witness to the fact that I am free.
        * The voluntary worker in capitalism can identify himself as what he is and this changes nothing.
            * We feel free: we are enslaved precisely when we feel free, feeling is the form of servitude.
        * Two versions of Möbius strip reversal:
            * Following capitalist freedom to the end turns into the very form of servitude.
            * In order to break out, our assertion of freedom has the form of voluntarily serving a cause.
* Klein bottle: subject falls into the abyss, redirects the tube into which it is falling aside and ends up looking up at the rounded space of the cave.
    * Enclosed space evoking a scene-setting.
    * Protuberance (tube) that functions as a blind spot in the image is the point where the spectators are inscribed into the machinery sustaining the closed circular space.
        * I and my reality form a truncated whole which disintegrates if I am cutout of it.

Metzinger, cognitive sciences, three metaphors:
* 1. Plato's cave:

    * There is no self who is tied down in the middle of the cave and can then leave the cave in search of the true light of the sun.
    * The self is a shadow of the cave as a whole, the cave sometimes projects a shadow of itself onto one of its walls.
* 2. Representationalist metaphor:
    * The phenomenal self is the little red arrow in your conscious map of reality
    * The external arrow is opaque whereas the conscious self-model in the caveman's brain is largely transparent; characterized by the comprehensive subjective experience of being situated.
        * "Red arrow" is the signifier which represents the subject for other signifiers.
* 3. Total flight simulator:
    * Has generated a complex internal image of itself within its OWN internal flight simulator, image is transparent.
    * "The pilot" is born into a virtual reality without a chance to ever discover this fact.
* BUT vicious circle; the cave cannot simulate the function of the observer.
    * While what the observer immediately identifies with in the experience of self-awareness is a fiction, his activity of observing is a positive ontological fact.
        * Additional convolution of the "snout" which gives birth to the observer.
* Limit of Metzinger's model is that it implies a clear-cut distinction between reality of the neuronal mechanism and fiction of the autonomous self as a free agent.
    * Ignores how objective neural processes have to rely on an efficient fiction, they can only function if the subject intervenes in reality in the guise of the "snout".
    * The point is to take into account of our "objective" view of reality is already subjectivized, functions from the standpoint of the impossible/monstrous Thing. The task is to relocate my subjective point-of-view in the Thing itself.
        * Christian task to become aware of how my god is simultaneously the view of hod himself upon himself.
        * Klein bottle: insofar as my view of the curved wall originates in the twisted snout, it is the Real itself which observes itself on the wall of the cave.
    * Bohr defense of the objectivity of measurement, defining this objectivity as the fact that the measurement gives the same result.
        * Lacan: Real as that which always returns to its same place.
        * Objectivity to be looked for in the whole situation into which we are included.

**Subject**: the snout, which is irrepresentable in the Klein bottle (in three-dimensional space).

Inside reality, the subject sees the wall of reality as a complete image, the snout is the blind spot of the image, the subject's own inscription in the image.
* On the inside, the snout is empty tube, *($)*.
* From the outside, it is an object, *objet a*, the subject's stand-in.


Christianity, creating its own past, fossils: true **historicity** is opposed to evolutionary **historicism**, asserting the **primacy of synchrony over diachrony**.
* Universe of ideological meaning is closed, its openness is illusory, the result of the invisibility of its limitation.
* The exclusion of the object-snout is constitutive of the appearance of reality; reality is constituted through the withdrawal from it of the object which "is" the subject.

Möbius strip vs Klein bottle:
* Möbius: pass from one side to the other, one term to its opposite
* Klein: pass from the hole in the midst of a circular body to the substance of this body itself.
    * Only way to arrive at subjectivity because subject is pure difference and emerges as such when this difference is no longer reduced to a difference between parts of some substantial content.

# Corollary 3 The Retarded God of Quantum Ontology**

Lacan: point of departure for science is Galileo's establishing of relations of letter to letter.
* Reemergence of autonomous letters happened in biology; chemical construction of DNA molecule out of elements and laws of science alone.

Symbolic references and its ontological implications: hypothesis that material reality is sustained by a network which displays homology with the symbolic space: the self-reflexive turn of the Klein bottle must be inherent to reality itself at its most basic.

## The Implications of Quantum Gravity

Rovelli's quantum gravity:
* Undermines Big Bang, if time and space are quantum entities, they cannot be infinitely condensed.
* Abandoning duality of space-time and particles/waves which fluctuate IN space-time.
* World is made from quantum fields, they do not live in space-time, they live on top of each other.
* Space and time perceived in large scales are approximate blurred images of the gravitational field.
* Möbius strip reversal: beginning with common reality and progressing to basic constituents of reality, we encounter waves. What we encounter in ordinary reality as their temporal/spatial form is another element of content, another quantum wave function.
    * Form is inscribed into its content as one of its moments.
* Only heat distinguishes the past from the future; irreversible process. Temporal process takes place at the macroscopic level.
    * Loops are always closed, processes are reversible in the "basic texture" of reality (quantum waves).
    * Time is an effect of our overlooking of the physical microstate of things, time is our ignorance.
* BUT cannot be averages, approximations, we perceive an idealized form of a chair which persist as the same. Macroscopic "illusions" have a status and efficiency of their own.
    * A "complete description" does not include high level orders.
    * Hegel: ignoring the most basic level is a positive condition of perceiving the higher unity.
        * There is no synthesis between the basic quantum wave level and our speech that produces meaning; to get one we have to ignore the other.
    * Lacan: "objectivized" knowledge, knowledge embodied in the virtual entity of the big Other.
        * Symbolic registration
        * The big Other is virtual, fragile, its status is that of a subjective presupposition, it exists insofar as subjects act as if it exists.
            * Similar status of ideological Cause; the only thing that really exists is the individuals and their activity, the substance of the cause is actual insofar as individuals believe in it and act accordingly.
* Collapse of the wave function, externality: an event becomes fully itself only when its external surroundings "take note" of it.
    * Moment of collapse, three replies:
        * The real of measurement--- contact between quantum micro-reality and ordinary macro-reality is in registration in measuring machine.
        * Imaginary of perception--- when the result is perceived by a consciousness
        * Symbolic inscription--- when the result is inscribed in the language shared by the community of researchers.
* Big problem: why and how the quantum universe itself immanently require the collapse of the function, its "de-coherence", how is the collapse inherent to the quantum universe?
    * It is required that observations occur, but it is not predicted by quantum theory.
    * The collapse is an additional postulate which must be made in order that quantum mechanics be consistent.
    * How can an act (observation) affect objective reality, erasing the multiplicity of superimposed states *(Copenhagen interpretation)*?
        * *MWI (many-worlds interpretation)*: all possibilities are actualized.
    * Neither of the two levels can be elevated into the true reality, the ultimate undecidability of the choice.
        * *Materialist*: there is nothing but quantum waves, but this nothing itself is a positive fact, there must be some kind of gap/cut in the basic grammar which opens up the space for the collapse of the function.
            * *Klein bottle*: rounded surface is pre-ontological, less than nothing: the hole in the midst indicates an abyssal attractor which drags down the field, *pushing "less than nothing" to Nothing*, the Void against the background of which something (reality) may emerge.
            * Third level of the abyssal Void through which pre-ontological Real is transubstantiated into macroscopic reality.
                * The Void provides the distance from which form can appear as the external container of its content.
            * The snout retroactively gives birth to the mollusk of the Real.
* *Ontological triad* of:
    * Quantum proto-reality (Hegel's shadowy world)
    * Ordinary physical reality
    * "Immaterial" virtual level of Sense-Events (language) in which the pre-ontological real returns.
    * Symbolic reality is incomplete, needs intervention of a Master-Signifier.
        * Physical reality also needs a homologous "quilting point"
            * Reality is not fully itself but decentered with regard to itself, it becomes itself retroactively, through its registration.

Schelling: gap between Being and Ground of Being:
* The Real of pre-logical drives is the spectral domain of the not-yet-fully constituted reality.
* Real Ground of Existence is impenetrable and at the same time spectral, "irreal", ontologically not fully constituted.
* Existence is ideal, yet fully existing.

Hegel: pre-conceptual chaos is not unfamiliar.
* *Logic of Science*: "Being, pure being--- **without any further determination**" adds minimal idealization through repetition.
    * First being is not yet pure being which coincides with its opposite, but pre-ontological "less-than-nothing" (den); the primordial repetition places proto-being into the purity (empty space) of Nothing and thus becomes something.
    * *Retroactivity*: the first being only retroactively becomes being.
        * Indeterminate immediacy is a retroactive product of the advent of retroactivity itself.

How does formalization itself arise out of the non-formalized?
* What causes decoherence is the subjective gesture of measurement.
* Presupposition of a minimal gap between things in their immediate brute proto-reality and the registration of this reality in the medium of the big Other.
    * Delay in registering; the agency who registers is not "creating" the observed reality but registering an outcome which remains fully contingent.

The ontological cheating with virtual particles (electron can violate the principle of energy on condition that it redoes it before its environs "take note" of the discrepancy).
* Ultimate agency of taking note of everything; god himself doesn't control the quantum processes.
* There are microprocesses which are not registered by the god-system.
* God is necessary illusion.
* Positive ontological status of ignorance, as it is inscribed in the structure of reality itself.
* *Absolute Knowing*: the ignorance registered by the subject is that of the big Other itself.


Dialectics of universal, particular, and singular: the singular is the return of the universal in the particular.
\1. Universal as neutral space
\2. Particular features united by One
\3. Singular: One is a punctual point of Nothing and is Universal
* Every One is as One the same One.
* Nothing as the heart of a thing, its self-identity.
    * Beckett; "everything divides into itself" (divides itself from itself so that the division that establishes itself is the division into one and nothing)

Does the assertion of the quantum character of space-time invalidate Kant's thesis on the ideal character of time and space?
* No, time and space emerge as forms
* How does the form detach itself from the "mollusk" to make it into its content?
    * There has to be an abyssal Void already in the "mollusk", Void provides the distance.

Negative vs infinite judgement, "material reality is non-all"; no implication of exception
* Negative judgment "material reality isn't all there is" is inherent to the positive statement "material reality is all there is" as its constitutive exception, it grounds its universality.


## The Two Vacuums: From Less than Nothing to Nothing

Democritus'** "den"**: elements which literally count less than nothing on the ontological scale.
* E.g. Möbius strip doesn't collapse into its abyss because it is LTN, needs additional input of energy to reach* the Void*.
* The true event is not the rise of something from the Void but the rise of *the Void* itself.

The dimension which is needed to account for the Klein bottle is a **negative dimension of a LTN**, a space which has to be supplemented in order to get nothing.
* LTN is the external surface of the bottle
* "Snout" is the X to be added to LTN in order to get the screen against the background of which somethings can appear.
* X is the operator of the passage from LTN to somethings.
    * *Nothing* is the abyssal axe around which less-than-nothings and more-than-nothings (somethings) circulate.
    * *Negation of negation:* an object which is a spectral appearance with no substantial substance beneath it, but an object which is less than nothing, which has to be added to a state of things to that we get nothing.
* Nietzsche: The first passage is the passage from wanting nothing to wanting Nothingness itself.
    * LTN is not field of pre-ontological oscillations out of which here and there negativity/subject/reality emerges through the snout.
    * LTN is not just chaos prior to even Nothing, it is a particular entity which IS "less than nothing", something that supposedly exists only in symbolic space and not in reality.
* Debts, negative states exist already in pre-symbolic reality.
    * *Higgs field*: it is energetically favorable for the Higgs field to be switched on; nothing has to be sustained by an investment of energy, it costs something to maintain the void of the pure vacuum.
    * Two vacuums:
        * "False" vacuum in which the Higgs field is switched off. "False" because it can only be sustained by energy expenditure.
        * "True" vacuum in which symmetry is broken, there is certain differentiation of particles and forces, the amount of energy spent is zero.
    * The reason why there is something and not nothing is that something is cheaper than nothing energetically.
        * *Den*: cheaper than nothing, pre-ontological "something" which is less than nothing.
    * Two Nothings:
        * The Nothing of the pre-ontological den
        * Nothing posited as such, direct negation (negating pre-ontological Nothing, positing it as a direct emptiness).
    * The first act of creation is the emptying of space, the creation of Nothing.
        * Freud: death drive and creative sublimation are intricately linked.
    * Materialism: irreducible distance between the two vacuums.
        * Nirvana as the return to a pre-organic peace is a false vacuum, costs more than the circular movement of the drive.
    * Drive: difference between goal and aim:
        * The drive's goal is false, masks its true aim which is to reproduce its own circular movement by repeatedly missing its object.
        * From the standpoint of libidinal economy, it is "cheaper" for the system to repeatedly traverse the circle of drive than to stay at absolute rest.

**Den vs objet a**:
* Den:
    * Less than nothing
* Objet a:
    * More than one, less than two, spectral supplement that haunts the One, preventing its ontological closure.
* Materialism: there is nothing between zero and one
* Lacan: one can never get from One to Two (binary signifier is primordially repressed, there is no sexual relationship)
* Objet a is den processed through the One.

Three levels of the functioning of the excessive element:
* Less Than Zero (**Den**, "Higgs boson")
    * Element which makes nothing cost more than something
    * Element which should be added to the pre-ontological chaos to get pure vacuum
* Between One and Two (**objet a**)
    * The One is never a pure One, always supplemented by its shadowy double.
    * E.g. Francis Bacon's uncanny protuberance of stain-like forms accompanying bodies.
    * Lacan's **lamella**, destabilizes beyond repair the organic Whole of the body.
    * Sexual difference separates One (Sex) from itself--- there is no Other Sex.
* Between Two and Three
    * There is the Two plus an excess which disturbs their harmony.
    * MF+
    * Two principle classes plus *rabble* (excess of no-class).
    * This excess makes out of a difference the Real of an antagonism.
    * **Sinthome**: the Two, couple, plus the One of **y'a de l'un** which makes class relationship impossible and possible at the same time as its constitutive obstacle.

Sexual difference and class antagonism:
* In both cases, there is no immanent sublation of the difference, the only way to get over it is to annihilate sexuality or classes as such.
* Solution is not mutual recognition of classes (Fascist vision of society), it is an antagonistic difference where the way out is the destruction of one pole and/or the move to totally different social organization with no classes.
    * Since sexes cannot disappear, the solution is *the disappearance of sexuality itself*: sexual difference is an antagonism which appears as the co-existence of two subspecies complementing each other (masculine and feminine).
* Brought to its extreme, the multiplicity of particular entities can be reduced to one so that we get a genus which has two species, a species as such and itself.
    * *Sexual difference*: difference between species (masculine) and the universality of genus embodied in an unlocatable excess (feminine).
* **Starting point is less than zero**, pure minus without a positive term with regard to which it would function as a lack/excess.
    * NOT the impossibility of the One to fully actualize itself as One,
    * Impossibility of Zero (Void) to achieve the stability of Void: the void itself is split between the pre-ontological chaos and the Void proper.

Den is an inverted objet a:
* Objet a is virtual substanceless X that supplements actual object
* Den is X that has to be added to pre-ontological vacuum to make it the Nothing.
* *Den as $*, the barred subject in its proto-form, at its most basic
    * Kant: transcendental subject constitutes objective phenomenal reality through its synthetic activity.
    * Heidegger: *Dasein* is a "being-there", the site of Nothing, of Being itself as the Void against the background of which entities appear.
        * Ontological disclosure does not ontically create entities, the something out there does not exist yet in the full ontological sense.
        * Dasein as the operator of transformation into the Void of ontological Nothingness.

Dens → $ → Void (nothing) 
* An opportunity makes a thief... out of a thief


Three levels of antagonism:
* Two are never two
    * *Sinthome* registers the antagonism, the non-relationship
    * *Klein bottle:* a convoluted sinthome arises out of the fact that Two is never Two, this non-relationship of the Twos has to be kept in check by a sinthome.
* One is never one
    * *Objet a* registers the antagonism, impossibility to be one
    * *Cross-cap*, One is minimally self-divided
* Nothing is never nothing
    * *$* registers the antagonism, impossibility to be the Void at peace with itself.
    * Circular movement of the *Möbius strip*

Dialectical materialism: there is no peace even in the Void, there is a constitutive incontinence of the void.
* "What is Sex?" "Incontinence of the Void"


## Is the Collapse of a Quantum Wave Like a Throw of Dice?

Gabriel Catren: return to pre-critical realism
* Endorses Meillassoux's return to pre-Kantian: humans have the capacity to describe and theorize nature as it is "in itself"
* Rejects universalization of contingency into a basic axiom of ontology.
    * Instead, speculative physics of Schelling and Hegel is possible.
    * Meillassoux transposes Kant's self-imposed epistemological limitation into a feature of nature-in-itself which appears a lawless kingdom of pure contingency.
* Quantum physics provides the most complete description of nature-in-itself available to us.
    * Only quantum mechanics can demonstrate how the multiplicity of appearances is induced by the thing's objective properties themselves.
        * "Eternal" essence of a thing and its appearances are fully mediated, the essence is nothing but the structure that regulates its appearances.
* Synthesis of multiple appearances into self-identical objects is not the act of transcendental subject but is immanent to objects.
    * *Phase transformations/ eidetic variations* interchange the different phases of the object without modifying it objectively.
    * The scope of "eidetic variations" is circumscribed by the invariant structure of the table-in-itself.
* Parallel between the collapse of a wave function and the throw of a die:
    * Catren: uncertainty principle implies that god IS throwing dice. Collapse concerns NOT the objective reality of the object but only one of its phenomenal phases.
    * The impossibility of establishing position when we measure momentum is an objective property of the particle.
        * No need to appeal to a transcendental argument to explain the impossibility of gaining access to all the objective information that defines an object.
    * Difference between collapse and die:
        * Die exists even if no one is throwing it, wave function is nothing but a superposition of its possible "throws".
        * Wave function: the thing "in-itself" is the scope of virtual paths with no substantial thing behind it, the substantial thing is something that emerges as one of the possible appearances.

Schelling and Hegel remain within Kantian horizon, reality is subjectively mediated.
* The Real "in itself" is virtual while "hard" reality of things is subjectively constituted.
* There has to be some kind of registering agency (big Other) through the medium of which the wave function collapses into reality.
* This agent has to be minimally in delay with regard to the function. There has to be a gap which opens up the space for quantum processes non-registered by the big Other.


# Scholium 3.1 The Ethical Möbius Strip

Specific form of "coincidence of the opposites": oppressive brutality is presented as its opposite, as an instrument of liberation.

* Biodegradable bullets: the thing itself is the remedy against the threat it poses
    * E.g. George Soros, Bill Gates
* Social control and domination can no longer appear as infringing on subject's freedom, it has to appear as the very self-experience of individuals as free.
    * E.g. Deprived of universal healthcare, freedom of choice to choose healthcare provider.
    * Imposed "free choices", we experience our freedom as what it effectively is: a burden that deprives us of the true choice of change.

Ultimate choice between abstract liberal humanism and the ethics implied by radical emancipatory struggle is structured like a Möbius strip:

* Progress to the end of the side of liberal humanism, we condone the worst criminals
* Progress to the end of partial political engagement, we find ourselves on the side of emancipatory universality.

# Scholium 3.2 The Dark Tower of Suture**

*Dark Tower (2017)*:
* Tower can be read as the kid's "sinthome", holding his world together.
* Correct ontology: our "civilized" reality is held together by an element which is foreign to it and functions as the bridge, point of passage, to non-civilized dark world.
* There is never just one island of reality heroically persisting in the surrounding chaos, every reality is always split into at least two.

# Scholium 3.3 Suture and Hegemony**

Laclau: "hegemonic empty signifier" is the quilting point that sutures a social field.
* Ambiguity:
    * 1. Privileged particular element which "colors" its universality
        * E.g. capitalism, all domains of production appear as species of industrial production.
    * 2. Empty element which holds the place of what is excluded from it, of its externality
* Two ways the balance of universality is disturbed:
    * 1. Exceptional element hegemonizes the universality
    * 2. Element which represents within the series the external dimension which eludes its universality.
        * Marx: oppositional determination, a universality comes to existence as such in the guise of its opposite.
            * E.g. royalism exists as republicanism
            * E.g. human species as such exists in the guise of proletariat, of those who have no specific place within the social body.
* The relationship between the two universalities provides the minimal form of social antagonism; antagonism is ultimately that between the particular element which hegemonizes universality and the element which, within this universality, stands for what is excluded from it.
    * E.g. when even individuals who possess nothing, precarious workers are defined as self-entrepreneurs, the antagonism is between entrepreneurs and proletarians, between these two universalities.

# Scholium 3.4 The World With(out) a Snout

Badiou: the Absolute is "touched" by the generic procedure enacted by a historical agent/subject.
* How is a gap in the texture of finite reality, appearance of a heterogeneous dimension of eternal Truth in it possible?
    * Zizek&Zupancic: death drive is not positivity, crack in positive reality, radical self-relating negativity.
    * Badiou is too "positivist" in Truth-Event: exception to the order of Being as positive Truth.
        * ZZ: the space for the exception is opened by the void of radical negativity. We touch the Absolute in the experience of a redoubled failure.
    * Difference between ZZ and Badiou qua sexuality and love:
        * Badiou:
            * Sexuality belongs to the order of Being
            * Love is eternal, miraculous crack in the order of Being
                * Reads *"il'y a pas de rapport sexuel"* in a wrong way, its radical meaning is that human sexuality cannot be located in the order of Being, introduces a cur of impossibility, this cut opens the space for love as that which supplements sexual non-relationship.
            * Objet a (ontic reality, object of fantasy) and evental act of falling in love (form of traversing the fantasy) is different.
                * ! Similar to Christianity dismissal of sexuality as animal passion and sees spiritual dimension exclusively in love.
        * ZZ:
            * Objet a is not just an element of Being, cannot be reduced to object of fantasy, there is already an "infinitization" in it since it is a finite stand-in for the Void.
            * Drive is a form of sublimation, so passage from sex to love is located within the "immortal" space of sublimation.
                * Love supplements the deadlock of our brush with the Absolute that is sexuality.
    * Klein bottle:
        * Sphere inside the bottle is Badiou's transcendentally constituted "world", but Badiou cannot answer How the worlds emerge from indifferent multiplicity.
    * How do we pass from logic to phenomenology?
        * There can be no world without at least one other world, the logic of their interaction is what opens up the space for Event: the world is not self-consistent, implies antagonistic tension with another world.
        * Being---World---Event---PURE DEATH DRIVE:
            * Badiou: an event is a fragment of being, part of a given situation.
            * ZZ: there is nothing but the order of Being: the Event doesn't curve the space of Being through its inscription into it, an Event is NOTHING but this curvature of the space of Being.
                * All there is is the ontological non-closure of the order of Being.
                * Event vs Being; engaged subject vs neutral observer.
            * Why is the event irreducible, causally non-deducible from the situation? Kant vs Hegel:
                * Kant: Event is irreducible on account of the finitude of the subject who is engaged to the Event. In-Itself of the radically contingent mathematicized multiplicity.
                    * We cannot adopt the neutral view over the infinity of Being.
                * Hegel: creation ex nihilo, the non-All of reality.
                    * The Event is NOT a fragment of being because it emerges out of the void in the order of being (*the void referred by suture*).
            * Being-Event-Death Drive:
                * Event is a distortion of Being, "Event" names a minimal fetishization of the immanent distortion of the texture of being into its virtual object-cause.
                * Badiou cannot account for the Unconscious in terms of "human animal" in opposition to the subject.
                    * Unconscious distinguishes humans from animals: death drive, distortion of the animal instinctual life, is what renders a life capable of transforming itself into a subject of Truth.
                    * There is no "human animal", from birth, instincts are denaturalized, functioning beyond the pleasure principle.
                        * Notion of animality as the balance disturbed by human hubris is a human fantasy.
        * Problematizing the premise of the "finite" order of Being as positive fact.
            * True dialectical thought starts by problematizing the full actuality of the finite reality itself; the greatness of ancient skepticism was to doubt the existence of the "obvious" finite material reality. 
            * "Human animal" is the silent "pathological" presupposition of Kantian ethics, man as ruthless utilitarian egotist.
        * Badiou posits the transition from being to appearing, to the emergence of a world, as a fact.
            * BUT, domain of appearing arises because the Real "in itself" cannot be what it is.
        * Formulas of sexuation:
            * Badiou: Event as exception to the universality of Being.
                * Masculine subject as exception to the human animal
            * Freud: "death drive" is not exception, it is the formal frame within which pleasure-principle functions.
                * There is no exception to pleasure principle, but it cannot be totalized. Psychic life doesn't strive for pleasure, turns around as meaningless blind repetition.
                * Death drive is the form, self-destructive "what's the point?" of the search for pleasure.
                * Feminine subject, self-sabotaging withdrawal that undermines the smooth functioning of the human animal from within.
        * Badiou vs Hegel:
            * Badiou: Truth-Event as cut into the flow of reality.
                * We can observe reality as continuous historical process, ignoring the evental level, and we miss nothing.
            * Hegel: "eternity" is historical, stands for a conceptual structure which is here "eternally" once it is here, retroactively transforming the past and opening up a new future.
                * Every order of Being is grounded in a Truth-Event, reality emerges as the "reification" of the Event, Event becomes a World.

# Scholium 3.5 Towards a Quantum Platonism

Kieslowski, *Blind Chance* (1981), notion of a mere chance (catching the train or not) which can determine the outcome of a man's life.
* Unacceptable by communism, deprives it of its deep moral foundation.
* In every case, the hero would construct his life story with a 'deep necessity'.
    * Lacan; **futur antérieur**, will have been of the Unconscious.
* The hero more or less remains the same considerate person in each alternative universe; three eidetic variations that enable us to extract the "eternal Idea" of Witek.
    * "Fundamental" fantasy is never experienced by the subject, isn't present in the variations.
        * E.g. "my father is beating me", can only be retroactively reconstructed as the presupposed reference of the other two fantasies.
        * The contours of the "impossible" fantasy can only be discerned through the "inhuman eye".
        * Walter Benjamin, translation: transposition of metaphor into metonymy, instead of a metaphoric substitute, both original and its translation are posited as belonging on the same level.
            * The gap that separates the original from its translation is transposed back into the original itself; goal of translation is to supplement the original.
            * A good translation destroys the myth of the original's organic Wholeness, it renders this Wholeness visible as a fake.
            * Both versions are conceived as fragmentary variations of an impossible Idea which can only be discerned by way of bringing out all its variations.
        * The new possibilities opened by a certain act are part of its content.
        * Trump opened ?? Up a space where other outsiders might do a good job.
            * Trump ignores the unwritten silent pact which determine how we should practice explicit rules. Today's Left is in advance terrified of any radical acts ignoring the unwritten rules ("will our acts cause panic?"... "will our enemies be mad and react?").
    * Phenomenology of the purely virtual eidos/idea
        * NOT of Heidegger
        * Disengagement which enables to perceive reality as it were viewed from outside.
        * Deleuzian transcendental empiricism, thick web of virtual variation which surround the reality of a thing.
            * Virtualities of woman, underlying the actual existence, distort its realist shape and bring out the potentialities inscribed in the thing itself.
            * Paintings think, perform the violent process of tearing apart the elements
                * Hegel--- infinite power of understanding, the absolute power.
        * Materialist reading of Plato: the Idea itself comes-to-be through the distortion in reality.
        * Psychoanalysis, one collects all variations in order to reconstruct their "absent center", purely virtual form negated in a specific way by every variation given in reality.
        * Political implications: 
            * Trump bothered by Europe's transnational unity.
            * Difference between phenomenal and structural Social Democracy, manifest and latent.
            * Not just return to the Idea of Europe, but to reinvent it, discover what was actually never there.
                * Zupancic: the true choice is between losing it all and creating what we are about to lose... let's first built the totality (unity, community, freedom) we are about to lose.
                * What we want to save from a nuclear disaster is not the reality of our world but the reality as it might have been if it were not hindered by antagonisms which gave birth to the nuclear threat.
                * The Idea of Europe kindles against all odds and becomes palpable in the moments of danger.
    * We can never obtain the "natural" couple because the fantasmatic support of this "ideal couple" would have been an inconsistent figure.
        * Possibility of undermining the hold of fantasy through over-identification with it, embracing within the same space the multitude of inconsistent fantasmatic elements.
        * The stake of fantasy is to obfuscate the social antagonism.

# Theorem IV The Persistence of Abstraction

## Madness, Sex, War

The obstacle/antagonism is immanent: the radical negativity which threatens to destabilize every identity is inscribed into its very core.
* The external threat of war is what sustains a civilization from within.
* *Möbius-strip* reversal in task of civilizing the relationship between civilizations themselves.
    * Hegel: ethics of the state culminates in the highest act of heroism, readiness to sacrifice one's life for one's nation-state, which means that the wild barbarian relations between states serve as the foundation of the ethical life within each state.
    * We cannot directly "civilize civilization" by expanding the peaceful relations guaranteed by the rule of law into the global sphere of international relations
        * Kant's worldwide republic is missing the barbarian core of war and killing enemies in the heart of each civilization which sustains its ethical edifice.
    * Progressing into the center of the ethical edifice of a state results in the opposite side, battle for survival with the external edifice. Each individual's readiness to participate in this barbarism is the ultimate support of the state's ethical edifice.
        * How to resolve?
            * Standard: offer another warlike struggle (ecological, class warfare) to replace war between states, another struggle which would function as universal.
* Schelling's "formula of the world"
    * Matter is gradually "idealized", however, this entire process is rooted in an external point of singular density (Ego as the ultimate self-contradiction).
    * Social edifice of higher ethical forms is sustained by the brutal violence of war.

Abstraction persists as the excess of abstract negativity which cannot be sublated into a concrete totality.
* Madness
    * Hegel; is inscribed into individual spirit's basic ontological constitution as a potential madness.
        * NOT that every soul must go through this stage of derangement.
    * "Normality" can only arise as the overcoming of this threat.
    * Relationship between the abstract and the concrete:
        * Abstract determinations (healthy consciousness) are always-already embedded in a concrete Whole as their presupposition.
        * Nevertheless, the notional reproduction/deduction of this Whole has to progress from the abstract to the concrete.
            * E.g. crime presupposes rule of law, can only occur as its violation, it must be grasped as an abstract act that is "sublated" through the law.
    * Madness is located in a space opened up by the discord between actual historical development and its conceptual rendering.
        * Insofar as madness presupposes normality while conceptually preceding it, a "madman" is the subject who wants to "live" the conceptual order; to act as if madness also effectively precedes normality.
* Sexuality:
    * Once within the human condition, sexuality is not only civilized/transformed, it is changed in its substance, it is now a drive that gets thwarted as to its natural goal (reproduction) and explodes into an infinite, properly metaphysical, passion.
    * In fighting its natural obstacle, opposed natural substance, the Spirit fights itself, its own essence.
* True problem: the moment we pass from Substance to Subject, from Life(-principle) to Death(-principle), death in its "abstract negativity" forever remains a threat, excess which cannot be economized.
    * Does this mean we are back at the excess of negativity which cannot be sublated in any reconciling synthesis?
* War as social madness:
    * In war, universality reasserts its right against and over the concrete-organic appeasement in prosaic social life.
    * No organic social order can effective contain the forces of abstract-universal negativity.
    * *Tarrying with the negative*: war remains a threat of total disruption of organized state Life.
        * Humanity is reconciled with nature when it realizes that its own antagonisms are "natural", they continue in a higher potency the antagonisms and imbalances that define nature itself.
* Understanding → Reason: the power of "tearing apart" is displaced from "merely our mind" into things themselves, as their inherent power of negativity.
* Rehabilitating the Lacanian notion of Imaginary:
    * As a triad IRS, Imaginary is reduced to a site of illusions.
    * Shift from Symbolic to Real; Imaginary and Symbolic are condensed into a singe entity.
    * Lacanian reading of transcendental imagination: imaginary as a possible name for the violent act of dismembering which tears apart every organic unity.
        * Not just as synthesis but as analysis.
* Concrete universality's infinite includes "abstractions" in concrete reality itself, as their immediate constituents.
    * Hegelian move; abandoning common-sense empiricist notion of abstraction as step away from the wealth of concrete empirical reality with its multiplicity of features.
    * Thought begins when we become aware of how a process of "abstraction" is inherent to reality itself.
        * Marx: the abstraction of the value of a commodity is its "objective" constituent.

## How to Do Words with Things

Theory of assemblage:
* Relations of exteriority imply autonomy of the terms from the relations between them
* Assemblages are productive
* Assemblages are heterogeneous; no a priori limits to what can be related.
    * Socio-material, they eschew the nature-culture divide.
* Dynamic of de-territorializing and re-territorializing, territories emerge and hold together, but constantly mutate, transform, break up.
* Assemblages are desired; continuous flows and partials objects are constantly coupled with desire.
* World as multiple and performative, vs. Single pre-existing reality.
    * *Dingpolitik*; revolves around things and issues of concern, rather than around values and beliefs.
        * Vital role of non-humans in concrete situations;
* The state as an assemblage.
    * Effect of power rather than the origin of power.
    * One should focus on reconstructing the socio-material basis of its functioning.
    * Concept of assemblage renders hegemonic assemblages open to political change by exposing their contingency.
* Leftist emancipatory slogans:
    * E.g. "the struggle against Islamophobia and the struggle for women's rights are one and the same struggle"
        * In the mess of actual politics, these are separate struggles which work against each other.

Communist reorganization of society; how could one put together in a different way large-scale organization that regulate water supply, health, security etc?
* Laclau:* chain of equivalences*, assembles heterogeneous elements as part of the antagonistic struggle of Us against Them, antagonism traverses each element from within.
    * Totalitarianism vs authoritarianism:
        * Totalitarianism: "who is not for us is against us"
            * Withdrawal from active support is not tolerated
            * Antagonism is absolute, no third option
        * Authoritarianism: "who is not against us is for us"
            * Doesn't tolerate direct opposition, thrives on indifferent passivity
            * Antagonism is softened, neutrality is co-opted by power.
* Assemblage does not bring pre-given elements together, each element is already traversed by a universality which cuts into it as a universal antagonism/inconsistency, this antagonism pushes elements to unify, to form assemblages.
    * Elements don't strive for assemblage in order to become part of a larger Whole, they strive for assemblage in order to become themselves, to actualize their identity.

How is language embedded in a material life-world of practice?
* Language is always part of materiality but always involves a gap, distance towards it.
* Ontological status of the subject:
    * Gould: "ex-aptation" is immanent to a symbolic structure. Elements are continuously torn out of their context, re-totalized into new fields of meaning.
    * Step to* subjective cut*:
        * Badiou: objectless subject
        * Lacan: subject is always correlated to an object, *objet a*.
            * Politically correct prohibition of asserting the particular identity of white man:
                * Presents itself as the admission of guilt,
                * Confers on them a central position; the prohibition makes them into the universal-neutral medium, the place from which the truth about the others' oppression is accessible.
                * Self-denial doesn't go far enough, its position of enunciation remains that of a privileged universality, renunciation is sustained by the surplus-enjoyment of their moral superiority.
    * Objet a is what effectively rips the seamless texture of reality and holds the place of a gap in it.
    * Subject itself is the rip in reality; ontological crisis, crack in the ontological edifice of reality.
    * Subject IS the trauma, traumatic cut in the order of being: subject is not related to, haunted by X, subject IS this X.
* The crack disappears in the notion of praxis, engaged activity that sustains a collective life-world.
    * Wittgenstein: Notion of language as an organic moment of social praxis:
        * Language is NOT the mirroring of reality, it is a part of it and an active intervention in it.
* Lacan: the alternative misses/presupposes the opening of the gap that potentially separates words from things.
    * How does the gap that allows a speaking being to acquire a distance towards reality arise within reality itself? 
        * Prior to active intervention, language enacts withdrawal from direct immersion into life-world activity.
            * *Symbolic castration*: violent process of acquiring-a-distance, tearing apart reality.
            * Hegel: infinite power of Understanding
    * Language never "fits" reality, mark of radical imbalance which prevents the subject from locating itself within reality.

New triad of **universality---particularity---singularity**: how can assemblage theory explain the regularity and stability of the characteristics of the individual entities?
* By adding a diagram to singularity:
    * "Virtual structure of possibility spaces"
    * D&G: "single abstract Animal for all assemblages that effectuate it"
* We do not get the abstract universality of Animal but a matrix of all variations and permutations, diagram of its becoming (temporal structure).
* The diagram is the assemblage's transcendental dimension.
* Revolution: transcendental change where the singularity's virtual background is transformed and what was impossible becomes possible.
    * Love: new "potentialities" of sexual pleasure are not a pure In-Itself which was already there before it was discovered; the In-Itself is generated through a relationship with the other.
    * Vs. Graham Harman; what an object is in itself is not immanent to it independently of its relation to others.
        * E.g. coffee and milk, coffee-without-milk becomes a part of its diagram, a *"proximate failure"* of milk.
            * Failure is key to identity; what things are in excess over its actions are their failures registered in their virtual dimension.
* Must distinguish accidental failures from those whose non-actualization appears as accidental but is effectively essential to the identity of the object.
    * Some variations are essentially *non-realized*
    * *E.g. capitalism: *its hegemony is sustained by the liberal-pragmatic idea that one can solve problems gradually, one by one.
        * Problem of underlying "utopian" premise.

## The Inhuman View

Assemblage theory, flat ontology. How to accept the subversive edge of the notion of "inhuman view" without regressing into naive realism?
* Subversive potential comes out when we apply the assemblage to describe a constellation which also comprises humans, from an "inhuman" standpoint so that humans appear in it as just one among the actants.
* New Materialists: aleatoric dynamics immanent to matter.
    * Emergent properties arise out of non-predictable encounters, agency for any particular act is distributed across a variety of kinds of bodies.
        * Agency as social phenomenon, the limits of sociality are expanded to include all material bodies participating in the relevant assemblage.
        * Ethical implication, recognizing entanglement within larger assemblages.
            * Sensitive to demands of assemblages, publics.
* Inhuman view is looking at Auschwitz as assemblage including us, so that we become strangers to ourselves, released from our human coordinates.
* Only the shattering experience of the ethical impossibility of an "inhuman view" gives rise to a proper ethical stance. Double paradox:
    * Inhuman standpoint implies pure Cartesian subject
    * Is there a subject for an outside view? Do we see only dead objectivity from outside?
        * Subject is presupposition, hypo-thesis: we impute subjectivity to what we see.
        * Subjectivity is its own performance; something that appears to itself while its "material base" is just a neuronal-biological apparatus.

How can a subject step outside itself and adopt this inhuman view?
* *Pure subject*/cogito, distinguished from any humanism or "wealth of personality"
    * Pure impersonal punctuality of a void/crack in the texture of reality, 
    * NOT subject without objectivity: it is sustained by *objet a* which positivizes a lack.
        * The fact that there is no subject without object introduces historicity into the ahistorical emptiness that is $.
        * Objet a appears as what it is, the objectal form of the surplus itself only in capitalism.
            * Surplus-value , surplus-enjoyment
    * Marxist criticism: the very appearance as abstract "empty" subjects exempted from all objectivity is a result of concrete social relationships.
        * Rejection:
            * 1. *Historicity*
                * NOT "all things are historically specific and caught in a process of eternal change"
                * Involves a tension between ahistorical traumatic core and its historically specific configurations (attempts to resolve the tension).
                    * Tension between the Real (hyperbolic excess) and its (ultimately always failed) symbolization.
            * 2. There is always one configuration in which the trans-historical universality appears as such.
* E.g. Cogito as such only appears (becomes true in practice) in capitalist modernity.
    * Will the empty subject disappear with the eventual overcoming of that market abstraction?
        * NO; capitalism, as an exceptional mode of production thriving on crises, brings out the hidden universal truth of all other modes of production so its effects cannot be undone.
        * Radical beginning after capitalism, entirely different.
    * Deleuze: "Self" stands for the way a human organism appears to itself, there is no one behind the veil of self-appearance.
* How is an entity which functions as the appearance of nothing to itself possible?
    * Substance → Subject: inaccessible core of object → inaccessibility as such.
    * Lacan desubstantializes the Unconscious (cogito as Freudian subject)
        * "Unconscious" neurological processes form the subject's natural substance, but this substance is not subject.
* *OOO*, there is no place for fantasy (as de-subjectivized, separated from the subject whose fantasy it is, inaccessible to subject).
    * Fantasy, pure a-subjective phenomenon, pure appearance permeated by excessive libidinal investment, too subjective to be assumed by the subject.
        * Separated from a subject but continues to presuppose a subject.
* Butler (subjectivity) vs Lacan (barred subject):
    * Butler: barred subject appears to guarantee incompletion of interpellation; liberal subject is engaged in continuously expanding the content of its identifications.
        * *Liberalism*: bar is not inscribed into the notion of subject, it signals incompleteness as a series of contingent exclusions that can be gradually undone.
    * Lacan: bar excludes the subject from the entire domain of objectivity. Bar separates something from nothing, the nothing/void which "is" subject.
        * The subject is not an object.
        * Subject is NOT the void which eludes objectivization --- this would be Sartrean subject.
        * Subject exists only insofar as part of its psychic content is inaccessible to it (fundamental fantasy), cannot be subjectivized by it. If the subject gets too close to it, the subject disintegrates.
        * Objectless subject → subject exists only as separated from its objectal counterpart.
        * Not integrating/subjectivizing the fundamental fantasy but suspending its structuring power: *traversing the fantasy*.
            * Price is "subjective destitution", reduction of the subject to a zero-point, disintegration then rebirth of the symbolic universe.
            * MeToo: more than a progress in modern history of emancipation since it suspends the "fundamental fantasy" which sustained the notion of sexual difference from prehistorical times until today.
        * *Primordial repression* grounds (opens up the space for) a specific mode of* historicity*.
        * Laclau; dialectics of hegemonic process, the struggle is not between particularities but universalities. For the struggle to occur, a bar has to affect universality itself, which makes it impossible and opens up the space of hegemonic struggle.

## The All-Too-Close In-Itself

* Butler's theory is transcendental historicism: discursive practices are the usurpassable horizon of our experience.
* OOO: pre-critical realism


BOTH exclude "**primordial repression**"
Gap that separates phenomenal world from the way reality is in itself:
* Masculine exception:
    * Kant: clear distinction between the subject's direct self-experience and the inaccessible noumenal reality which persists outside my reach.
        * Cheating, he does not desperately want to get in contact with the In-itself, he is afraid that our act may really be an act of freedom.
        * True tension in Kant: the free act in its abyss is unbearable, traumatic, so that when we accomplish an act out of freedom, we experience it as conditioned by pathological motivation: free act cannot be schematized into experience, so we have to "pathologize" it in order to integrate it into our experience.
        * Misreads the "Real as the impossible which happens" with the "Real as the impossible-to-happen (cannot ever fully accomplish)"
    * Modern science: the in-itself of reality can only be grasped through mathematic formalization.
* Feminine non-all:
    * Absolute Knowing is NOT "knowing everything there is to know" but the transposition of the external obstacle to the subject's knowing into the heart of the subject itself.
        * Ignorance is totally internalized.
        * Deleuze: the in-itself is more phenomenal than our shared phenomenal reality, it is the impossible phenomenon, excluded from our symbolically constituted reality.
    * The in-itself is discernible in the cuts that separate different spheres of transcendentally constituted reality, it is what makes every "external reality" inconsistent, non-all.
        * The cuts are the sites of the intervention of subjectivity into reality.

How to break out of our transcendental horizon as indelible mark of our limitation?
* We reach the Real only when we reflect on how we fit into the reality of objects around us.
* The vision of "democracy of objects" or the "inhuman" view of an assemblage are only possible from the standpoint of an empty subject.
* Only the violent abstraction from one's particularity enables us to adopt the view on reality in which humans are one among objects.
* Subject is a standpoint, punctual support of a perspective onto reality from which we cannot abstract.
    * Limitation leads to openness: freedom as the obverse of our ignorance.
* Metaphor ---indirect speech--- cannot be paraphrased in literal speech without a loss.
    * "True meaning" itself gets lost.
    * What is "withdrawn" of Being is fully immanent to its disclosure, it is the form of this disclosure itself.
        * Heidegger: Being discloses beings through its withdrawal.
        * Unconscious; "there is no big Other": the Unconscious is fully immanent to subjectivity, its status is virtual: fully immanent to speech and does not exist somewhere else.
* *OOO* speaks from privileged position of enunciation from which subject itself appears as just another among objects, the subject stands on its own shoulders.
    * Lacan: I am always in the picture, but I am inscribed into it as a stain in the picture, as something that doesn't fit into it.
        * Virtual Real instead of real reality:
            * Neurons are also virtual, direct intervention which bypasses the level of perception, the Real is generated by radical virtualization itself.
            * Sexuality: staging impossible fantasy in virtual reality, "artificial" sexual enjoyment much more "real" than anything I can experience in "real reality".
            * Neorotheology: "spirit is a bone".
* *Oppositional determination:* every universality remains attached to by the a posteriori, a particular content.
    * Yes, the universal notional form imposes necessity upon the multitude of its contingent content, but it does it in a way which itself remains marked by an irreducible stain of contingency.
* Link between oppositional determination and subjectivity:
    * All the signifiers are not on the same level, a "reflexive" signifier is the signifier of the lack of the signifier.
        * The reflexive signifier of the lack represents the subject for other signifiers.
    * Subject: the "subject of the signifier" involves no lived experience, consciousness etc.
        * Basic operation is counting 0 as 1: the absence of determination is counted as a positive determination of its own.
    * *Substance as subject*:
        * NOT ONLY that a subject perceives reality from its distorted/partial standpoint
        * Subject itself only emerges if a structure is "distorted" through the privilege of a hegemonic particular element which confers a specific color of universality.
        * The surplus of the in-itself over the phenomenal reality is ourselves, the gap of subjectivity.

Four points:
\1. Reality consists of multiple assemblages, each is built around its immanent impossibility (central antagonism).
\2. Central antagonism implies that something cannot be done without ruining the system, even if it appears possible within the coordinates of the system.
* Ideology sustains illusory and structurally necessary hopes, e.g. the hope that the democratic frame allows for radical changes if only the majority votes for them.
\3. Assemblage implies subjectivity:
 * At zero-level, subject is its own pure possibility which remains non-actualized.
* The moment it is actualized, it is "substance" and not "subject".
* Subject only "is" as the outcome of the failure of its actualization.
\4. Even the most "asubjective" description from an inhuman view implies a subject.
    * Subject as the punctual reference-point
    * What kind of subject sustains this view?
        * The empty Cartesian cogito.

# Corollary 4 Ibi Rhodus Ibi Saltus!

Three anniversaries in 2017:

* 150th of Marx's capital
* 100th of the October Revolution
* 50th of the Shanghai Commune

What went wrong? Fourth anniversary, 500th of Martin Luther's publication of Ninety-five Theses.

## The Protestant Freedom

Three modes of freedom:

\1. I am free when I am not hindered by external obstacles.
* My acts can be determined by objective neuro-bio-social conditions, what makes them free is that no external obstacle hinders them.

\2. Freedom as self-control, free when I remain able to decide against temptation.
* Aristo, slaves: slaves are "free" in the sense that they do what they want, while free men follow duty.
    * Consumerist slavery where I am allowed to act at random but remain as such enslaved to the stimuli of commodities.
    * BUT on behalf of what am I able to resist my immediate or mediated natural inclinations? (can there be a pure choice of evil?)

\3. Free choice that is motivated by objet a; no limitation to our freedom because the object is the subject itself in its objectal mode, object which does not pre-exist desire but is posited by it.

Martin Luther: "good works do not make a good man, but a good man does good works".
* More than just a necessary illusion, complex mechanism of recreating the eternal identity itself.
    * Once something crucial happens, we see that it had to happen---but it may not have happened.
        * E.g. risky political decision, if we are skeptical, we don't trust the scared majority but if the decision is taken and enacted, we feel it was destined to happen.
        * Authentic political acts, "impossible" happens and by way of happening, it rewrites its own past and emerges as necessary, even "predestined".

**Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Protestanism**:
* Orthodox tradition: "theosis", man becoming (like) God. "God became man so that man can become God".
    * BUT god became man and that's it, there is no resurrection to follow, the Holy Ghost already IS resurrection.
    * *Protestanism*: God became fully god only through his self-division into god and man.
* Three incompatible positions:
    * God is absolutely impenetrable Beyond
    * God is absolute master of fate which is predestined by him
    * God gave us freedom and made us responsible for our deeds.
* Protestanism brings together these positions: everything is predestined by god, but since god is impenetrable Beyond for me I cannot discern what my fate is, so I am left to do good deeds without any calculation and profit in view, i.e. in total freedom.
    * Radical acts of freedom possible only under the condition of predestination: terrifying situation where we have to decide what to do, knowing that our decision is decided in advance, is the only case of real freedom.

Freedom disappears if we locate a human being in objective reality, as one among objects--- there is no space for freedom at this level.
* Necessary move from the enunciated content to our position of enunciation.
* E.g. scientist demonstrates we are not free, what does this imply for the position from which he speaks?
    * Reference to the subject of enunciation is irreducible, it is foreclosed by science.
    * Need the question of the horizon from which I see and say this.
* Psychoanalysis makes me even more responsible than traditional morality, it makes me responsible even for what is beyond my conscious control (for the overdetermination by unconscious mechanism).
    * Works on one condition: the subject is absolutely constrained by the unsurpassable horizon of its subjectivity.
        * Against Kantian way, presupposing pure transcendental subject non-affected by any catastrophe, a subject which is operative as a virtual point of reference.
        * We should act as if the entire universe was created as a backstage for the struggle of emancipation.
* "Let's try to imagine how the world is independently of us" approach brings "gray" objective structure, subjectless world, a negative image of subjectivity itself.
    * Since we are subject, constrained, we should focus on what the fact of subjectivity implies for the universe and its structure.
    * Subjective derailment IS the universal truth of the world.
    * We are "universal beings" only in our full partial engagements.
    * No sacrifice in Protestanism, a believer as empty subject IS sacrifice of all substantial content, emerges through second death.

## Jumping Here and Jumping There

Hegelian reconciliation; one has to recognize the heart in the cross of the present
* Philosophy cannot teach the state what it should be, but only how it, the ethical universe, is to be known.
* *Hic Rhodus, hic saltus*
    * To apprehend what IS is the task of philosophy because what IS is reason.
    * A theory cannot transgress its time.
    * **Here** is the rose,** here** dance; the barrier which stands between reason (as self-conscious Spirit- and reason as present reality, is some abstraction which is not free to be conceived.
    * Reason is apprehended as the rose in the cross of the present.
* *Ibi Rhodus ibi saltus!*
    * **There** is Rhodes,** there** jump!
    * We are ready to jump here in any way, on condition that we can rely on some form of big Other which guarantees consistency of it all.
        * E.g. Leftist intellectuals, academic career *here*, revolution going on *there*.
    * The belief in the Other (modern form of believing that the Other does not know) helps maintain the same state of things, regardless of subjective mutations and permutations.
* Solution: jump here, but in such a way that you don't rely on any figure of the big Other.
    * Reconciliation: the subject should achieve reconciliation by way of "recognizing myself in my Otherness" (in the alienated substance which determines me.
        * I should realize that the Otherness of the substantial content is constitutive of my Self.
        * Ibi Rhodus ibi saltus: overcome your alienation in the Other by way of recognizing that that Other itself does not possess what you are lacking.
    * Actual ethical deadlocks?
        * Negative theology as an obstacle to self-instrumentalization.
        * Self-instrumentalization presupposes the big Other whose privileged interpreter and instrument is the revolutionary agent.
        * One should abandon attempts to know what the Other wants from you and assume your position in this world, while realizing the Other as a "hole" in this position, a subtraction from it.
            * The tension of the cut of the Absolute into the Aristotelian universe can only be resolved by thinking one (the divine Absolute) as the subtraction, the hole in the Other.
            * Self-instrumentalization enables the agent to avoid the radical openness of the struggle.
    * Potentia absoluta (vs potentia ordinata);
        * NOT some transcendent/impenetrable god of Beyond
        * The "irrational" miracle, a hole in reality, the incarnation/revelation itself.
            * Revelation is not logos but the break of the Absolute into logos.
    * Hegel: "objective riddle"
    * Modernity of the book of Job: God comes in at the end not to answer riddles but to propound them.
        * God performs a point de capiton; resolves the riddle by redoubling it, transposing it into "the thing itself".
        * NOT good or bad God, God-the-Father who doesn't know what he is doing. Christ is the one who does know it but is reduced to impotent compassionate observer.
    * God can perceive the horror of his creation and the fact that the highest Law-giver is himself the supreme Criminal only by falling into his own creation and wandering around it as an impassive observer.
        * The function of Christ is to fill in the gap in the big Other, to provide the little bit of the real that sustains the symbolic/virtual order.
        * Holy Spirit is not a new figure of the virtual big Other, but the spirit of a community which accepts the non-existence of the big Other.
        * Incarnation is the separation of god from himself.
    * "No God in Auschwitz" implies that God cannot understand the humor generated by the experience of Auschwitz.
        * God's job is to understand suffering.
        * Another God, that of sacred terror, who was alive in Auschwitz.
        * Today, god is alive again in his most terrifying real (fundamentalism), but we don't know it and don't want to know it.

## Four Ethical Gestures

Why do we need god at all?
* Minimal theological experience of being out of place in this world.
* Protestanism makes visible that we exist because god himself is out of himself.

Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Protestanism = ISR
* Orthodoxy, imaginary fusion between man and god
* Catholicism, symbolic exchange between the two poles
* Protestanism, the "subtracted" god of the intrusion of the Real.

New Age critique of the Cartesian subjectivity:
* The original sin is man's assumption of central place in universe, exploitation.
* Today's ecological, social and psychic crisis is interpreted as the universe's justified answer to man's presumption.

Excess of subjectivity as only hope of redemption: true evil resides in the ontologization of the excess, in its re-inscription into some global cosmic framework.
* True arrogance is false humility, emerges when the subject pretends to speak and act on behalf of the Global Cosmic Order, posing as its humble instrument.


Ambiguity is evil: Nazi Holocaust or Gulag, which is worse?
* Breaking out of the cycle of the fundamentalist and liberal positions; giving up quasi-neutral distance that tries to do justice to all concerned factions.
    * Fundamentalist: grounding ethical commitment in particular ethnic/religious identity excluding others.
    * Ethical universalism, every authentic ethical position paradoxically combines universalism with taking sides in the ongoing struggle.
        * True universalists are those who engage in a passionate fight for the assertion of the Truth that engages them.

Four examples contouring an** authentic act:**
* Stepping out; *The Children's Hour*
    * Breaking out of a closed social space.
    * Three betrayals:
        * The grandmother apologizes, apology is easy way out and not sincere. Betrayal masked as an ethical act.
        * Husband asks the question, getting baited to asking the question.
        * Martha's suicide, escape from the truth of her desire which she compromises by killing herself.
    * Karen's final walk is an autonomous act, non-pathological decision. What motivates her is not any secret sexual economy but pure ethical stance.
    * After the withdrawal, how do we step in again and intervene?
* Act of compassion: *A Conspiracy of Faith*
    * Which God appears? A Christ-like impotent witness offering his compassion and solidarity, displaying pure goodness in the face of a meaningless and indifferent world.
    * Goodness can only emerge at the point of inhuman view, cruel indifference and meaninglessness.
    * Atheism and Christianity
        * Not only is Christianity the only truly consequent atheism (God is dead), atheists are the only true believers.
        * Tribulations: pure faithful believers are useless opportunists who play the safe game. Only the impure doubters are able to fight actual battle for Christ.
* Suspending the ritual: *Parsifal*
    * What pushes us to engagement when no figure of big Other vouches for it?
    * Is the ethics of compassion not that we need others' suffering to do and feel good?
    * Instead of historicizing Wagner, more productive approach is to brutally transpose the setting into our contemporary world: Klingsor the impotent pimp, Kundry whore, "Grail" as rival gang, Titurel the drug-crazy father, whose ritual of drug taking Amfortas has to do.
    * True evil figure is Titurel:
        * Immobile oppressive presence who barely breaks his silence with the superego-injunction "Reveal the Grail".
        * Obscene undead apparition, so immersed in enjoyment of the Grail that he perturbs the regular rhythm of its disclosure.
        * Pere-version; obscene dark underside of father's authority.
    * *Feminine hysteria*: "I demand that you refuse my demand, since this is not that."
        * Male dread of woman is the dread of feminine inconsistency, inconsistent multitude of masks.
        * Kundry embodies the self-contradiction of a hysterical position: she wants to seduce Parsifal and to be redeemed by him.
            * She is stuck, unable to see the identity of the opposites.
        * Parsifal, hysterical identification; Parsifal's very rejection of Kundry contaminates him with hysteria.
        * Kundry's laughter; repeats itself apropos of every master she served.
            * Obscene laughter reveals that the master is impotent, a semblance of himself.
            * Both a mockery of the other, but also for despair at herself for her repeated failure to find a reliable support in the Master.
            * Parallel between Amfortas'  and Christ's wounds:
                * Christ himself wasn't pure in his suffering, Kundry laughs at his obscene jouissance.
        * Kundry is looking for somebody who would be able to resist the temptation of converting his pain into a perverse enjoyment.
        * Parsifal, reversal of the wound:
            * Miserable wound,  eternal sign of corruption, wound that makes me immortal, condemned to eternal suffering.
            * After it is healed, blood flows out freely.
            * Radically changes the mode of the functioning of power; no need for a redeemer or sacrifice.
            * Wound is healed when it is no longer experienced as a threat.
            * Evil-obscene immortality → source of eternal bliss.
    * Hegel:
        * The Spirit is itself the wound it tries to heal, the wound is self-inflicted.
        * Spirit is the wound of nature; subject is the absolute power of negativity of introducing a cut/gap into given-immediate substantial unity, power of differentiating, abstracting, treating as self-standing what in reality is part of an organic unity.
        * Spirit's self-alienation + non-substantial character: there is no res cogitans, Spirit is nothing but the process of overcoming natural immediacy, alienating itself from it.
        * There is no Self that precedes the Spirit's "self-alienation"
        * Self-alienation is the same as its alienation from its Other (nature), because it constitutes itself through its "return-to-itself" from its immersion into natural Otherness.
        * Negation of negation is the "simple negation" which remains attached to the presupposed positivity it negated, only the negation of the substantial character of this Otherness itself, full acceptance of the abyss of Spirit's self-relating which retroactively posits all its presuppositions.
            * Origins are truly lost, their very loss is lost.
            * Spear that smote you:
                * Colonialism; the very disintegration of traditional forms of communal life opens up the space for liberation.
                * Bureaucracy: Parsifal, disintegration of the ritual
    * Does this mean that the new community needs no rituals?
* Empty ritual: *Wind River*
    * Native father knows and assumes that he cannot practice "death face" with full immersion, but improvising and sitting there with it works as authentic in its very artificial gesture: it may be shit, but shit works in its very minimal gesture of withdrawal from life engagement.
    * Why is it the ethical responsibility of the oppressed and colonized to make the first step towards subjective destitution, subverting "authentic" tradition and replacing with the new universal "unknown" new lack of identity?
        * Point is not teaching, the oppressed are in the privileged position of standing for the authentic universality, in contrast to the false universality of hegemonic ideology.
        * Conflict is between two universalities, that of the hegemony and the authentic universality embodied in those out-of-place in the hegemonic order.
    * Homosocial bonding motif can be read as commercialized and mythical resolution of the antagonisms.
        * No antagonism is resolved, they are brought to an extreme, the two men share grief and their impotence in the face of brutal violence against their daughters.
        * The message of the Native father is that he shares with the White father the distance the latter feels towards the Native American Ritual
            * *Möbius strip reversal*: when we progress from the naive immersion in a ritual to its utter dismissal as something ridiculous, we find ourselves back in the same ritual and the fact that we know it is all rubbish doesn't diminish its efficiency.

Greimasian semiotic square:
* Negative non-ritualistic: stepping out
* Positive non-ritualistic: act of compassion
* Negative ritualistic: suspending ritual
* Positive ritualistic: empty ritual

# Scholium 4.1 Language, Lalangue

Abstraction cannot be reduced to a subordinate moment of a concrete totality, comes first, persists as the foundation of every concrete totality.

We should abandon the "fundamental moment" of materialism, the opposition between concrete material site of production and the ideal site of meaning as its effect.
* Primacy of abstraction means that representation cannot be reduced to an effect of production; it is here from the beginning as cut in production, gap that production endeavors to fill in.
* Lacan's opposition: language and **lalangue**
    * Minimal formula is L+, language and its excess.
    * Three terms, not two: language, lalangue, **matheme**
        * RSI: Real of matheme, Symbolic of language, Imaginary of *lalangue*.
        * *Matheme and lalangue*, coincidence of opposites: a homophony brought to extreme can turn into a matheme.
        * Matheme as "empty" formula, maintains its autonomy with regard to the meanings of its components, opens itself up to further meanings.
    * Language and lalangue; parallax cut that separates two incompatible dimensions, cross-cap.
        * Asymmetry,
            * NOT genetic primacy of lalangue as the bodily ground out of which language, its differential structure, emerges.
            * Ontological primacy of the differential character of linguistic signifiers.
                * Lalangue is secondary mimetic echoes in an already radically different field.
    * Lalangue itself is coincidence of opposites:
        * 1: it stands as the "apparatus of jouissance", language as the space of illicit pleasures that defy normativity.
            * Enjoy-meant, no communicational "use value".
            * Obeys the superego injunction "Enjoy!"
                * Capitalist self-valorization, circular movement of money generating more money.
        * 2: "really existing language" in contrast to language as a pure formal structure.
            * Language is not a neutral transcendental frame, it is penetrated/distorted by contingent historical forces, antagonisms, desires which pervert its purity.
    * "The unconscious is structured like lalangue?"
        * Educational systems promote globish, language deprived of lalangue.
            * Barbarism: cutting roots to local "maternal" culture".
            * Lalangue returns as the obscene support of public speech: military community has background of obscene unwritten rules and rituals.
                * Link between "subversive" pre-symbolic babble of the child (id) and the inaccessible Power that terrorizes Kafka's hero (superego).
    * Lalangue is punctual, there is no network of homophonous pairs.
        * Lalangue is not-all.
    * Problematic sexuation of the opposition; language follows masculine logic of universality grounded in exception, lalangue follows the feminine logic of non-all.
        * Hegel's reliance on homophonies and double meanings opens up speculative rational thought to the accidental vagaries of lalangue.
            * Invented "new concept of naivety"
            * It is only from the outside that we can discern the uncanny dimension of a language.
    * Language and lalangue are not distinct entities, their non-relationship is not L-ll but L+.
        * With regard to language, lalangue remains +, inconsistent chaotic addition.
        * Primary convolution is that of language, lalangue is ultimately the attempt to obfuscate the abyss of language by way of grounding it in homophonies.
    * The gap that separates language from lalangue (symbolic castration) precedes both terms of the opposition.
        * The basic opposition is that between language and what lacks in language.
        * The couple is language---(lalangue)
    * Language is a torture house of meaning occupied by the subject: speech not only registers a traumatic psychic life, the entry into speech is in itself a traumatic fact.
        * At a certain point, psychic turmoil itself is a reaction to the trauma of dwelling in the house of language.
        * Culture is attempt to cope with the trauma.
    * The agent of lalangue is Lust-Ich (ego drowned in the pleasure of homophonies).
    * Subject of the signifier is on the side of death, while lalangue is on the side of life and its pleasures.
* True materialist position is that one should assert* the primacy of the second term* in
    * *Production---representation*
        * Production can only emerge when the gap of representation is already here since the ultimate goal of production is to fill in the gap opened up by representation.
    * *Drive---desire*
        * The circular movement of drive can only function against the background of the loss that structures desire.
    * *Lalangue---language*
        * Yes, lalangue is the substantial "material base" of language, but as such, it tries to cover up the gap opened by language.
        * Insofar as culture retains the link to lalangue, it is not the cut with nature but a reaction to this cut.
* For modes of relating to language:
    * Praxis: engaged existence in social reality, we relate to things and other persons as part of our existential projects.
    * Lalangue: regression into Lust-Ich
    * Scientific stance: pure meta-language which forecloses the subject, erases all specificity of enunciation.
    * All three avoid/disavow/negate the cut.
    * Philosophy, poetry, mysticism.
        * Authentic poetry involves attempt to render palpable the cut on which the human entry into the Symbolic is grounded.

# Scholium 4.2 Prokofiev's Travels

Philippe Petit; traversing the gap between two towers.
* Domain of "undeadness", of getting rid of the material weight of life-substance embodied in sound
    * Silence, concentration
    * Inhumanly calm

Art: how can art combine aesthetic bliss with its function of being a medium of truth?
* Prokofiev, regress into "new simplicity" in Soviet works after short term of modernist experimenting.
    * Does the simple beauty function as a mirror of social despair so that it evokes what it tries to escape from?
    * Prokofiev's gnosticism, reading key demands of the Stalinist aesthetics.
        * His universe was "homogenizable" with Stalinism.
* Effect of sublime: contrast between the poverty and horror of real life and the sudden intrusion of Another Space.
    * Momentary suspension of meaning which transposes the subject into another dimension in which terror has no hold over him.
    * True contrast within music itself, between the sublime dimension of music and the trifling character of its content.
    * NOT simply escape, signals the awareness that the misery of the prison camp is not all reality.
* Prokofiev, escape into spiritual bliss does not work unencumbered, we get hints of darker dimension.
    * Struggle of something within the work, trying to break out, constantly finding its emergence "blocked" by the existing outward form and language of the piece.
    * His ironic stance is the falsely-bright obverse of the failure of his struggle to bring the "Thing from Inner Space" out.
* Gradual reversal of heroic self-assertion into destructive fury, Leninism → Stalinism
    * The outburst of "joy of life", "carnival" is that of racist pogroms and drunken gang rapes.

# Scholium 4.3 Beckett as the Writer of Abstraction

The "empty" Cartesian subject ($) is not only the agent of abstraction, it is itself an abstraction, emerges as the result of self-withdrawal from its real-life context.
* The "inner wealth" of a person is the fantasmatic "stuff of the I", imaginary formations which fill in the void that "is" subject.
* Objet a causes anxiety, is the objectal correlate of the empty subject.
    * The cause/agent of the narrator's emptying into a stranger whose true motivations are obscure and impenetrable.
    * The object which would have been lost the moment we were to learn the "true" particular cause of the narrator's actions.
* The abstraction enacted by the subject is the point of passage to a new concretion:
    * The direct experience of the unity of a body, voice fits organic whole, involves necessary mystification.
    * Focusing on one of the unity's aspects in isolation, voice, and then allowing this element to color our entire perception.
        * Concrete abstraction, abstraction which grounds its own concrete totality.
        * Exception is the only way to universal truth.

Becket does the opposite of concrete abstraction; he puts particular forms of terror and persecution into a series and blurs their distinctions, constructing an abstract form of de-contextualized terror; a Platonic Idea of terror.
* Why is it more truthful with regard to social totality itself than a "concrete" realist image of social totality
    * All is there, but not realistically represented, gap persists between the levels of reality and representation
    * "Material of expression"; universe depicted in Beckett, passage from the "material of experience" to that of "expression" is abstraction.
    * "Art of hindrance", state of deprivation that is material and ontological in equal measure.
        * Obstacle acts like Lacanian Real/Impossible which makes reality incomplete. The persisting unfreedom in a formally "free" society can be properly articulated only in an art which is no longer constrained to the "realist" representative model.
* *Catastrophe* (1982):
    * End of play, the prisoner addresses the audience; "bastards" are also members of the public who enjoy the show, "I will not resign myself to play the suffering victim in order to satisfy your humanitarian needs."
        * "You are part of the same hypocritical game, enjoying the spectacle of suffering which makes you feel good in your solidarity with the victim."

The circle is almost closed; humanitarian charity participates in the universe which creates victims, eco-sustainability reproduces the very ecological problems it claims to resolve, reforms of capitalism make it more efficient.
* It is impossible to break out of the circle, which means one can do it by means of a real-impossible act.
