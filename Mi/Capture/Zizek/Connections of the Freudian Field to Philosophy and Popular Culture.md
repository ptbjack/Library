Formulating theoretical point through popular culture.
* accepting total externalization, renouncing initiated closed circuit of knowledge.

# Subjective destitution 
analyst is not counted as another person, occupies the role of an object.
* psychoanalytic cure is over when the subject loses the anxiety of not existing and assumes their own non-existence.
- **Psychoanalysis vs empiricist-subjectivitst solipsism**:
	- Solipsism: one can be certain of ideas but external reality is inconclusive inference.
	- Psychoanalysis: outside reality definity exists, I myself do not exist.
- Renouncing the fetish of hidden treasure responsible for my unique worth, **radical externalization in the symbolic medium**.
	- uniqueness of my personality is provided by my fundamental fantasy (particular, non-universalizable formation).

# Different readings of "Desire is the desire of the Other"
Fantasy is an answer to the opacity of the desire of the Other. 
1. imaginary relationship of envy - I desire an object insofar as it is desired by the Other.
2. dialectic of recognition; the way my desire is structured through the order of the big Other.
3. analyst as impenetrable object: I can arrive at my desire only through the complication of the Other's desire only insofar as this desire is impenetrable, enigmatic for me.

Fantasy is split: the beautiful and the dirty fantasy are two sides.
- In ideology, there are always two fantasies (peaceful Nazi community and obsession with Jewish blood, traitors)

Two levels of ideology, there is no naive ideology.
- Ideology is always a gesture of denouncing another position as being naive ideology (returning to the natural order of liberal economics after communist artificial order)

**Even in politics it is necessary to at least acquire some distance towards the fantasmatic frame.**
- One can be political plotter and a devout christian (Huxley, *Grey Emminence*)
- ***There is no guarantee in your authentic private experience what the political effects will be.***

# Formulae of Sexuation
"Woman does not exist": Which woman? For whom does woman not exist?
- Standard answer of woman not existing within the symbolic order, somehow resists being integrated **might be wrong**.
- Feminine essence is ultimate example of male logic.
	- The construction that originally there was a matriarchal paradise gradually replaced by patriarchy is a patriarchal myth.
Kant's antinomies:
- Dynamical antinomy: abnormal set, "can an element be a class of itself?"
- Mathematical antinomy: paradox of infinite divisibility, indivisibility.
Feminine position:
- Assuming the inconsistency of desire (*Ce n'est pas, Ã§a*)
	- Horror of feminine inconsistency, hysterical woman moving from desperate pleas to cruel virago.
	- Hysterical theatre: what appears to be deadly serious reveals itself as fraud, what appears to be an empty gesture reveals itself as deadly serious.
- False opposition of woman as she is for man (male narcissistic projection) vs true woman in herself, beyond male discourse.
	- **Woman in herself is ultimately a male fantasy, we get much closer to the true woman by following the inherent deadlocks of the male discourse on woman to their end**.
Masculine position:
- States that are essentially by-products: man draws line of separation between the phallic domain and the relationship. **Always chooses symbolic duty (profession/mission) but is aware that only a relationship to a woman can bring him genuine happiness etc.**
	- sublime moment of melodrama when the woman realizes the man betrayed her for her own good.

# Non-all, class struggle:
- Every position we assume towards the class struggle is already a moment of the class struggle.
- **The class struggle doesn't exist since there is no exception.** We cannot conceive or apprehend class struggle as such. We are always dealing with partial effects.
	- NOT reducton of the universal to the particular, but a surplus of the universal. Every universal is a universal attached to a certain particularity.
	- Masculine position attempts to resolve the deadlock of too many universals by excluding **one paradoxical particular, which, as an exception, immediately gives body to the universal as such.**
		- e.g. lady in courty love; exists at the price of being posited as an inaccessible thing. She is transformed into an object that insofar as it gives body to sexuality as such renders the masculine subject impotent.


# Multiculturalism is always strictly Eurocentric:
- Actual multiculturalism = the tradition of a culture, its own communal heritage, appears as contingent.
- Only within modern-age Cartesian subjectivity is it possible to experience one's own tradition as contingent ingredient to be bracketed.
- **The universal notion of the multiplicity of peoples, each embedded in each particular tradition, presupposes an exception, a tradition that experiences itself as contingent.**

# Human rights: 
Rights of everybody who is really fully human. Everyone can be exception to this set.
Liberal democratic universalist right to difference encounters its limit the moment it stumbles against an actual difference.
- How are we to decide between the competing claims of an individual's rights and group identity when **the group identity accounts for a substantial part of the individual's self identity?**
- Liberal delusion that there is a neutral, non-violent way of informing the individual with the full range of alternatives. The form of informing is already experienced by the particular community as a certain minimal violence.
	- There is no neutral non-exclusive universality. **Whatever you do, you must accept a degree of violence.**

# History of sexual difference:
- Anthropomorphic universalization of sexual opposition.
	- mirror relationship between microcosm and macrocosm (metaphoric correspondence).
- Cartesian subject, radical desexualization of man's relationship to the universe.
	- reality as blind mechanism, universe does not have meaning. **Every search for deeper meaning of the phenomena is now experiences as the left-over of traditional anthropomorphism.**
- Lacan: we enter human sexuality through the intervention of the symbolic order as a heterogeneous parasite that derails the natural rhythm of coupling.
	- What is the link between the formulae and the still almost experiential fact that there is something biological about male, female?
		- there is no link. **Sexuality is the effect of the contingent act of grafting the fundamental deadlock of symbolization onto the biological opposition.**
	- Sexuality is ontologically a bricolage; montage of two totally heterogeneous elements.
	- In Lacan, **masculine and feminine are negative determinations (Kant)**. They determine a deadlock, a modality of how the subject fails in their bid for an identity that would full constitute them as an object.
	- The two sides do not add up to make the totality of man, we only get two failures.
	- vs Foucauldian constructivism (seuxality is a bricolage of heterogeneous discursive practices): sexuality emerges where symbolization fails. **We are sexed beings because symbolization necessarily fails**.
		- If it were possible to symbolize sexual difference, we would have one sex.
	- Discourse is split from within; there is no male discourse and another special, separate feminine discourse.

# 'And' as a Category
E.g. Althusser, *Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses*
- The first term is some notion of contradiction.
- The second term provide the concrete material conditions so that this notion begins to function as non-idological.
- The 'And' conjoins **the same content in its two modalities*.
	- Contradiction exists materially only in overdetermination
**Lacanian sexual dfference: Man is the universal first term, woman is the concrete existence**.
- vs Jungian obscurantist 'and' of complementary polarities.

# Woman doesn't exist vs Castration
- Empirical father, castration, as an agent of authority you are always decentered, not immediately the authority. **You are a stand-in for the absent symbolic authority**.
	- symbolic fiction
- Woman (and the Jew), logic where the more they are empirically destroyed, humiliated, the more they are all-powerful.
	- The more you kill them, the less they can be castrated. Within Nazi anti-semitism, the Jew cannot be castrated.
	- ***Spectral apparition***: the failure of the symbolic fiction to patch up a certain fundamental deadlock is posited in apparitions, in living dead. They are here as the embodiment of a certain symbolic deadlock.
**What this spectral apparition conceals is NOT social reality.** It emerges to fill up the gap of what cannot be symbolized (primordially repressed).
- 'Social construction of reality' always fails.
