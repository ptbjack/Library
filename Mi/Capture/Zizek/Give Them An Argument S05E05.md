Hegel wasn't Hegelian enough when confronting capital. He interpreted estates (state, farm, commerce) as intersubjective bonds, missed how labor power itself becomes a commodity under capitalism.
- Marx explained self-reproduction of capital in purely Hegelian terms; substance becomes subject.

Marx was in some sense more idealist than Hegel. Hegel's teleological model is only the way things appear to us. He prohibits any teleological speculation about future (what Marx does.)
- Hegel's historical development is one in which the Notion is caught. Development is not gradual approach to an ideal but the changing of content. LGBT+ is socialistic: in order for us to be equal, certain economic and social conditions must be met.

Social welfare state is falling apart; healthcare was a triumph, consensus that everyone should have access to it. Now, long waiting times, medicine lacking in Europe.
- **war communism**, full-blown crisis, no time for comfortable reflection.

Late Marx, obsessed with ecology; countryside vs towns, separation of waste from production.

Marx, self-transparent centrally planned society, **good alienation.**
- Engels: everyone gets according to his reasonable desires (lol).

In Davos, billionaires asked for tax raise; they know they will also pay the price of the catastrophes.

Zizek is now against "Russia should be seen to be defeated". 
- Now he says "Ukraine should survive". 
- Worst outcome would be Ukraine and Poland becoming Trumpian Eastern Europe.
- In Ukraine, rich oligarchs took care of themselves and ordinary people are mobilized.

Horkheimer: pessimist in theory, optimist in practice.
