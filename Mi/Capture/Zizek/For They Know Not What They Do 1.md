## The Hard Road to Dialectical Materialism

Philosophical weakness of *The Sublime Object*: quasi-transcendental reading of Lacan by establishing the Real as the impossible Thing-in-itself.
* Proper ethical stance seems to be heroically accepting the failure of every act.


Three modalities of the Real:
* Real Real - the horrifying Thing, primordial object e.g. Alien
* Symbolic Real - the signifier reduced to a senseless formula, the real as consistency e.g. quantum physics formulas which can't be related to the everyday experience
* Imaginary Real - unfathomable "something" on account of which the sublime dimension shines through an ordinary object.


The Real is all three dimensions at the same time.

Three modalities of the Symbolic:
* Real: quantum formulas
* Imaginary: Jungian "symbols"
* Symbolic: speech, meaningful language

Three modalities of the Imaginary
* Real: fantasy, imaginary scenario occupying the place of the Real
* Imaginary: image as such in its fundamental function of a decoy
* Symbolic: Jungian "symbols", archetypes

Three modes of the subject's decentrement:
* Real: neurobiology, objective reality of our illusory psychic self-experience
* Symbolic: the symbolic order as the Other Scene by which I am spoken, which actually pulls the strings
* Imaginary: fundamental fantasy, decentred imaginary scenario inaccessible to my psychic experience.

How is the Real inscribed into language?
* Language is medium of commitment, each statement commits me to give grounds for my actions and statements.
    * Abyss of freedom
    * E.g. , Marriage vows, they impose obligations, my life can collapse when I am compelled to confront its crisis publicly.
    * Inability to fully assume the commitment, resistance inscribed into the relationship between the subject and its symbolic representation.
    * Irreducible self-reflexivity: *"there is no meta-language*" means that *there is no language*, no seamless language whose enunciated is not broken by the reflexive inscription of the position of enunciation.
        * *Non-All*: there is no meta-language exception to language because language is 'not all', its limit is inscribed into it in the guise of ruptures in which the process of enunciation intervenes in the enunciated.
        * Radical gap between the literal meaning and underlying intention.
            * Poetic repetition that brings depth: "window ... window"
        * The reflexive turn towards self-awareness occurs when there is a 'malfunction'.
        * Shows the impossibility inscribed into language: its failure to grasp the Real.
* Religious ritual, 'only those who believe can understand it': the religious belief of those who participate is a "rationalization" of the uncanny libidinal impact of the ritual itself.
    * Gap is located in the thing itself, it splits from within the participants themselves who need a rationalization of meaning to sustain the Real of the ritual itself.

The Real is not the hard kernel of reality which resists virtualization:
* Virtualization of life-experience, reflective distance which prevents any full engagement 
    * e.g. sexual games on Internet, you are never fully committed, can always leave.
    * Missing Kierkegaard's full existential engagement (situations when we are cornered and cannot step back to judge the situation from a distance).
        * But, our location in a life-world is not ultimate fact:* "death drive"*, dimension which resists its full immersion into its life-world, blind persistence with disregard for the requirements of our concrete life-world.
            * Dislocated soul without a body, pure insistence.
        * Postmodern-deconstructionist-poststructuralists: the subject is always-already displaced, decentred, pluralized.
            * BUT the subject "as such" is the name of a certain radical displacement and all its identifications are ultimately failed attempts to heal the wound.
    * Opposition between reality and spectral illusion, the Real is the "irreal", a spectral illusion for which there is no room in our symbolically constructed reality.
        * The inert remainder foreclosed from reality returns in the Real of spectral apparitions.
* Shellfish, snails etc are uncanny because of the soft "naked" body inside the hard shell.
    * Squashy body as the figure of the Real.
    * The shell is like Heidegger's vase, symbolic frame which delineates the contours of the Real Thing.
    * It is uncanny that there is something rather than nothing inside the shell.
        * Soft body is remainder of the lost Thing.
    * The Real is that which gets lost in immersion into the life-world, consequently that which returns in the guise of spectral apparitions.
* *Sublime*, ethics of pure desire, Antigone.
    * Antigone's suicidal gesture, finding ultimate fulfilment in death is phallus as the signifier of desire
        * Women are the phallus; phallus appears in the guise of its opposite, the Woman whose fantasmatic figure combines three incompatible features (virgin, mother, man-eating murderess).

## From the Logic of the Signifier...

Hegelian dialectics and the Lacanian "logic of the signifier" are two versions of the same matrix.

Hayles: the Saussurean presence/absence opposition doesn't hold in the digital universe of "flickering signifiers" which exist only in the state of constantly flashing, re-created at each moment.
* Signifiers that are neither present nor absent
* Organizing principle: presence/absence → pattern/randomness (recognition of permanent pattern in the continuity of random change)
* "Negative" experience that grounds the symbolic order: "symbolic castration" (introduction of Absence which opens up the space for the interplay of presences and absences) → mutation (rupture of pattern so extreme that the expectation of continuous replication can no longer be sustained)

BUT

* Saussurean presence/absence is not the same as material presence/absence: the order of the signifiers is always minimally ideal: the texture of presences/absences is also a "pattern" of different relations that can be materialized in different mediums.
* Differentiality:
    * A signifier is nothing but the bundle of its differences from other signifiers.
    * Direct identification of pattern, no differentiality at work: pattern/randomness defines the imaginary order
        * Gestalt - a subject is able to recognize the occurrence of the same pattern in the multiplicity of shifting processes.

Why do we need a signifier which stands for the presence of meaning as opposed to its absence (S1)?
* Levi-Strauss: the actual network of signifiers is always finite, as such, inadequate. Language never says all and has to contain a signifier which fills the gap between the finite symbolic structure and infinite reality by signifying all future meanings which are waiting to be discovered.
* Transcendental necessity of S1: the empirical limitation of language is the positive condition of its signifying capacity.
    * Meaning as such is reflexive, the difference between the self-enclosed symbolic system and its outside must itself be inscribed within the system in the guise of a paradoxical supplementary signifier which functions as a stand-in for what the system excludes (what eludes the system's grasp).
    * Ultimate difference is not between the opposed meaning of two signifiers but between the signifier which means something (determinate, S2) and the "empty" signifier which means meaning as such.
* "Empty signifier" is signifier of symbolic castration, its presence marks the constitutive absence of the feature in question.
* Differentiality inverts the common perception of presence and absence:
    * NOT absence which is derivative of presence, but the other way around.
        * E.g. man is woman with phallus.
            * Absence precedes presence, phallus is imposture, lure which covers up a preceding unbearable Void.
            * Women entertain a closer relationship with nothingness.
                * *Subjectivity as such is feminine*:
                    * Woman and* semblance *(femininity as masquerade): semblance is an appearance which conceals a void, nothingness... the fact that there is nothing to conceal.
    * *Differentiality*: Montenegrin has to put both empty and full glass in bedside: the negative side has to be inscribed in the guise of the empty glass.

Three levels (e.g. political antagonism between the Left and the Right):
* Imaginary pattern
    * Gestalt pattern, positive identity preceding relations to others
* Symbolic difference
    * An element A is nothing but its difference towards non-A
* Real of the antagonistic relationship in which 'a difference is prior to the elements between which it is a difference'.


Yassir Arafat never misses the opportunity to miss an opportunity:
* Dialectical self-relating, has special positive capacity to miss opportunities.


Hegelian "negation of negation" oscillates between two mutually exclusive accounts:
* Happy ending to the deadlock with shift to another subject who takes over.
* Final twist introduces an even greater catastrophe which renders the previous one meaningless.

Kantian dimension that escapes Hegel is 'in Kant more than Kant'.
* Hegelian reflexive move: the surplus of/in Kant that eludes Hegel is the core of the unique Hegelian operation.
    * The Hegelian premise is that that the Kantian edifice is in itself inconsistent.
* Hegel's criticism: categorical imperative is empty, formal, cannot generate any determinate content.
    * Kant's point is that the formal emptiness confronts us with the abyss of our freedom, the subject is fully responsible not only for doing his duty but also for establishing what this duty is.
    * Kant was not aware of this freedom.
    * Hegel knows how Kantian self-deception is necessary: the 'true' position could have been articulated only through the illusory one.
        * Hegel's place is the difference between Kant's "true" position and its necessary misperception.
* Finitude of knowledge, impossibility of attaining the noumenal Thing-in-itself.
    * Kant: all universal notions yield knowledge only when they are applied to our sensible experience, notions have to be "schematized", provided with a procedure for applying them.
        * Knowledge is synthetic production, outcome of mind's active manipulation of sensual data.
        * Knowledge is limited to the phenomenal reality accessible to us as finite beings.
    * Hegel: absolute knowledge is not of the intellectual intuition prohibited by Kant, but the self-relating infinity of the circle of subjective grasping itself.
        * Instead of abandoning the metaphysical notion of Absolute Knowledge, Kant transposed it into the inaccessible Otherness of the Divine Mind.
        * Hegelian "true Infinite" is what emerges when we think the Kantian finite of the transcendental constitution and the subject's autonomous/spontaneous productivity without presupposing this displaced metaphysical Infinite.

## ... to Hegelian Dialectics

Hegel's dialectics is the definite formulation of the thought of the Twosome:
* NOT the all-encompassing One which mediates/sublates all differences
* NOT the explosion of multitudes (Deleuze)
* The split of the One into Two
    * NOT imaginary opposed forces
    * Split that cleaves the One from within, not into two parts: the ultimate split is between the One (Something) and the Void of its Place (Nothing).
    * Opposition between two species coincides with the opposition between the genus itself and its species: the same element encounters itself in its *"oppositional  determination"*
        * The opposition between the One and its Outside is reflected back into the very identity of the One.
    * Lacan: the minimal gap is that between an element and its place, S2 and S1, between the "ordinary" and the "empty" signifier.
    * {==Being and Nothingness are not two separate ontological entities: Nothingness is being itself viewed from a different perspective.==}{>>The dialectical process is ‘epistemological’, reveals the shifts of perspective in our grasping reality: these shifts concern the “thing itself”.<<}
        * Atoms and the void;
            * NOT two separate entities,
            * The void is the kernel of the self-identity of every atom, what makes it "One".

The Real is the "almost nothing" which sustains the gap that separates a thing from itself.
* Standard notion: "reality as a grimace of the Real"
    * The Real is the unattainable traumatic kernel, blinding Sun, perceptible only if we look at it awry, from a distorted perspective.
    * The Real is structured/distorted into the "grimace" we call reality through the pacifying symbolic network.
* Inverting the formula: "the Real is nothing but a grimace of reality"
    * The Real is something which is nothing but a distorted perspective on reality, shines through such a distortion, it is 'in itself' completely without substance.
    * *Appearance qua appearance*: not only appears within appearances, it is also nothing but its own appearance, certain imperceptible, unfathomable illusory feature that accounts for the absolute difference within identity.
    * *Materialism*: the Thing is a spectre which emerges in the interstices of reality, insofar as reality is never homogeneous/consistent, but always afflicted by the cut of *self-doubling*.
        * E.g. Whiteread's uncanny sculptures: artist fills the empty space (void in the middle) and later removes that which delineated this central void, what we get is massive object which gives body to the void itself.
            * Instead of the vase embodying the central void, this void itself is directly materialized.
        * Doubling is asymmetrical: God and Man
            * Positing the presuppositions: God is the impenetrable Ground out of which man emerges but it is only through man that God Himself actualized Himself, he "becomes what He always-already was".
* Idealism vs materialism:
    * Religion is the Real as the impossible Thing beyond phenomena
    * Atheism is the Real as the grimace of reality, as the Gap, the inconsistency of reality.
        * NOT the position of believing only in positive (ontologically constituted, sutured, closed) reality.
        * Religion without religion: the assertion of the void of the Real deprived of positive content, prior to any content: content is a semblance which fills in the void.
            * True atheist formula: "nothing will have taken place but the place itself".
            * The form of religion deprived of its content: the experience of the Void (present both in religion and atheism) is the original materialist experience and religion fills it in with religious content.
* Kant → Hegel
    * Standard notion of reality: hard kernel which resists conceptual grasp.
    * Hegel: non-conceptual reality emerges when notional self-development gets caught in an inconsistency, and becomes non-transparent to itself.
        * Limit transposed from exterior to interior: there is Reality because the Notion is inconsistent.
        * Multiple perspectival inconsistencies between phenomena are not an effect of the impact of the transcendent Thing, the Thing is the ontologization of the inconsistency between phenomena.
    * Special → General theory of relativity
        * Special: curvature as the effect of matter, only an empty space would have been non-curved.
        * General: matter is the effect of the curvature.
            * Lacanian Thing is the effect of these gaps and inconsistencies.
* Relating to the Void, two ways:
    * Void as the impossible-real Limit of the human experience, we have to maintain proper distance from the absolute Thing.
    * Void as that through which we should (always already have) pass(ed).
        * *Hegelian tarrying with the negative*.
        * Lacan, death drive and creative sublimation: in order for symbolic creation to take place, the death-drive (Hegelian self-relating absolute negativity) has to accomplish its work of emptying the place, making it ready for creation.
            * Objects which are nothing but the Void of the Thing embodied (objects in which negativity assumes a positive existence).
* Judaism → Christianity
    * Jewish God is the Real Thing of Beyond
    * Christ, "the Thing itself" is nothing but the gap which makes Christ not fully human.
        * Nietzsche: Christ is "Midday", between Before (Real) and After (Symbolic).
* *Interpassivity* in postmodern "self-reflexive" art: anticipating the reactions of the passive observer
    * Hitchcock:
        * The spectator is treated as an agent/actor (caught up in the story)
        * The actor/agent is treated as a baffled observe
    * Desire vs drive:
        * Standard reading:
            * Desire is linked to active subjectivity
            * Drive involves "subjective destitution", identification with the objet petit a
        * Actually:
            * Desire is interactive, it is the desire of the other, I desire through another. I can remain passive while my true place is outside.
            * {==Drive is interpassive:==}{>>Silent superego?<<}
                * Structure is 'making oneself seen, spoken'.
                * Scopic drive--- making oneself visible to the Other's gaze (objet a).
                    * E.g. dead man's empty eyes
                    * I am active for the gaze I externalize. I "am really" that impassive stain, the point of the gaze which I never see but for which I "make myself seen" by means of what I am doing.
                * The inscription of the gaze into the observed reality, reality is already "subjectively constituted".
                * *Shadow of a Doubt*:
                    * Discontinuity with cut to shocked gaze: the conversation that follows is an attempt to symbolize/domesticate this traumatic incident.
                * The true cause of the terrified gaze is not what we are told afterwards, but the fantasized traumatic excess "projected" by the gaze into perceived reality.
                    * Fight Club, The Usual Suspects etc. The illusory status of the illusion itself: the illusion that there is some supersensible noumenal Entity is shown to be an "illusion".
                        * We can never comprehend the "whole" of the reality we encounter: some part of it has to be "de-realized", experienced as a spectral apparition.

## The Act

Hegelian "identity of the opposites":
* Insofar as the royal family are branded with charisma, they are the people whose very "ordinariness" makes the stuff of our dreams.
    * They show human emotion for us, as our stand-in: duty to symbolize and express the grief via a public act.
    * Remoteness of their mystical charisma involves a "speculative identity" with its opposite (ordinary lives): the thirst for details of their lives sustains the charismatic dignity.
        * Far from reducing them to our scale, details render the gap between Him and us common mortals more tangible.
* Complementarity of "totalitarian" and "liberal" subjective positions:
    * Adorno: saying "we" and meaning "I", totalitarian position of presenting one's contingent subjective opinion as the impersonal objective/collective truth (instrument to the big Other "historical Necessity").
    * Liberal also: presenting the impersonal commonplace as your intense personal experience. "Expressing one's true Self" confers the form of the authentic Self on an imitation of public clichés.
* Paranoiac stance: it is itself the threat, the destructive plot, against which it is fighting.
    * Angleton's moles and at the end he is accused of being the actual mole: the deception came from failure to include in the list of suspects the very idea of globalized suspicion to* put the very idea of suspicion under suspicion *--- coincidence of opposites, Hegelian self-relating negativity.
    * Genus encounters itself in one of its own species.
        * Avarice:  the sin takes the form of a virtue in capitalism.
            * Kant: prudence becomes a sin when it is elevated to the properly ethical level, an end-in-itself.
            * Coincidence of opposites: not only is the vice of thrift (accumulation) the highest virtue: consumption itself is turned into the mode of appearance of its opposite, thrift.
            * How to escape capitalism?
                * Psychoanalysis, intersubjective money relationship in which all parameters of exchange break down.
                    * Why does the analysand pay?
                        * NOT Analyst is not doing the analysis for "goodness", as favor.
                        * NOT Tit for tat: so much for an interpretation of a dream etc., soon analysand is paying the analyst so that nothing will happen, the analyst will tolerate the analysand's babbling without subjective consequences.
                        * Giving what one is rather than what one has (Lacan's definition of love)
                            * NOT megalomaniac or suicidal (Nietzsche's megalomaniac madness) as it would be *passage a l'acte*, the subject offers his being as the object that fills the constitutive gap of the symbolic order.
                            * Payment must hurt. By accepting the payment as a purely arbitrary expenditure, the patient gets back the objet petit a, the cause of desire, that which can emerge only as a pure excess of Grace.
                * Vicious circle of thrift is broken: the patient does meaningless thing within the horizon of the capitalist logic of consumption/accumulation, and receives in exchange the pure surplus itself.
                    * *Act *dispels the mist of fantasy hesitations which haunt us in the gap between the abstract intention to do something and its actualization.
                        * NOT the divine mystical experience in which we step out of our normal experience of reality
                        * "Normal" experience is "ex-static", in which we are thrown outside ourselves into the external reality of entities.
                        * Lacanian act is not mystical suspension of ties to normal reality, it is the Original Sin itself, the abyssal Disturbance of the primeval Peace, the primordial "pathological" Choice of the unconditional attachment to a specific object.
                    * Buddhism, Lacanian act is closest to Bodhisattva's gesture: reaching nirvana and going back to phenomenal reality for the sake of the common Good, out of compassion.
                        * Lacanian act does this gesture just for the sake of it, without any reference to the Good.
                        * How did nirvana "regress" into getting caught up in the wheel of craving in the first place?
                            * The fall into Evil was accomplished by the original Bodhisattva, the ultimate source of Evil is compassion itself.
                        * Bodhisattva's compassion, *pleasure principle*, "we all strive towards the Good and the ultimate problem is epistemological".
                            * Freud: wanting unhappiness, excessive pleasure in suffering itself, self-blockade of human behavior.
                            * Hegel: passing beyond nothing, return to a phenomenal reality which is beyond nothing, Something which gives body to the Nothing.

## Zen at War

Western Buddhism, Oriental spirituality which is offered as the alternative to aggressive Islamic monotheism, preaches inner distance and indifference towards the frantic pace of free-market competition, is the most efficient way for us to participate fully in the capitalist dynamic.
* Corporate Zen: the attitude of total immersion in the selfless "now" of instant Enlightenment -absolute discipline coincides with total spontaneity- legitimizes subordination to the militaristic social machine.
* How does militaristic Zen justify killing?
    * Teleological narrative: killing and war are necessary as a means of brining into harmony those things which are incompatible.
        * Compassionate war: the sword that kills is the sword that gives life.
        * Socialism's mistake in wanting to realize the underlying unity (evil equality) directly in temporal reality, thus causing social destruction.
        * Hegel's assertion of the "identity of identity and difference":
            * NOT vision of society as an organic harmonious Whole, each member performing his particular duty and contributing to the harmony of the Whole.
            * The Absolute is at war with itself, self-destructive formlessness (self-relating negativity) must appear as such in the realm of finite reality.
                * Revolutionary Terror is a necessary moment in the deployment of freedom.
        * "Zen and the sword are one and the same"
            * Opposition between everyday reflexive lives and the enlightened stance in which the difference between life and death no longer matters and we* are *directly our act.
            * Zen message of liberation lying in losing one's Self in immediately uniting with the primordial Void is identical to utter military fidelity.
                * *Perverse desubjectivization*: subject avoids his constitutive splitting by positing himself directly as the instrument of the Other's Will.
                * Since there is no inner substance to religion, the essence of faith is proper decorum, obedience to ritual as such.
            * Difference between Zen militarism and revolutionary violence: revolutionary violence does not aim at establishing a non-violent harmony, it is more directly identified with violence: it is violence as such which liberates.
                * Freedom is the very violent act which disturbs the balance.
            * All-encompassing Buddhist Compassion vs intolerant, violent Christian Love: Christian love is a violent passion to introduce a Difference, a gap in the order of being --- to privilege and elevate one specific object at the expense of all others.
                * Violence is already at the love choice as such, which tears its object out of its context, elevating it to the Thing.
        * Openness sustained to allow things to appear in their proper being has been created by a gesture of withdrawal/constraint, even derangement.
            * Freudian *sublimation*:
                * NOT the displacement from the "direct" actualization of a drive to its more cultured ersatz-satisfaction
                * Intervention of an obstacle (*death-drive*) which thwarts the direct realization of the drive, thus opens up a space through which another dimension can shine.
                    * Death-drive "clears the plate", creates the Void/Opening in which the Other Thing can appear.
                * What is sublimated is not the raw direct satisfaction, but the impossible/real "noumenal" Thing itself.
                    * The supersensible noumenal Thing* is nothing but the* disturbance of the order of natural phenomena.

## Religion

The true greatness of Job whose suffering precedes that of Christ: he is not a patient sufferer, he complains all the time, rejecting his fate.
* Critique of ideology (of legitimizing suffering): Job's ethical dignity lies in the way he persistently rejects the notion that his suffering can have any meaning.
* True materialism consists in accepting the chanciness without the implication of the horizon of hidden meaning. The name of this chance is** contingency**.
* Christ's suffering is also meaningless, not an act of meaningful exchange.
    * The gap that separates the desperate suffering man from God is transposed into God Himself, as His radical splitting, self-abandonment.
        * God the Father dies, revealing His impotence, rises from the dead in the guise of the Holy Spirit.
* Christianity, religion of Revelation: no obscene superego supplement accompanies its public message.
    * What is revealed is that there is nothing -no secret- behind it to be revealed.
* Judaism, myths ("ethical substance") of community sustained by unacknowledgeable "spectral" fantasmatic secret history.
    * Butler: "stubborn attachment" to the unacknowledged violent founding gesture.
    * Repressed status of the Event gives Judaism unprecedented vitality.
    * The story of His impotence concealed by the standard pagan obscene supplements.

Freedom only in the traumatic encounter with the opacity of the Other's desire
* NOT getting rid of the Other's desire.
* Confronting the opacity as such, deprived of the fantasmatic cover which tells me what the Other wants from me.


Two readings of Song of Songs, one allegorical (sexual content is actually telling Divine meaning) and the other dismissing sexual content, persisting in the external opposition between the symbolic and its meaning.
* Actually, the spiritual dimension haunts human sexuality and distinguishes from animal coupling.
* Song of Songs is imaginary mitigation of a traumatic Real.

## The Act, Again

Atom Egoyan, *The Sweet Hereafter*:
* Paraplegic girl's lie act saves the community, enabling them to keep living in the fantasmatic bliss.
* Lévi-Straussian reading:
    * Same structuring opposition as Oedipus myth: overvaluation (losing children) and undervaluation (incest) of kinship ties.
    * The specter of the dream children was sustained by Nicole's lie, the parents don't have to face that their children did exist but now no longer do.

What holds a community together is transgressive rituals, no one can closely follow the explicit rules of a community.
* Society is a collective which can dispense with this set of unwritten rules.
* We are integrated into a culture only when we succeed in practicing the unfathomable distance from the symbolic rules, only this distance proclaims our identity.
* Ideology cheats by letting us know that its propositions are not to be read* a la lettre*.
    * Subversion sometimes consists in reading it in an excessively "literal" way.

Forced choice: "you are free to choose--- on condition that you make the right choice!" two subversive gestures:
* Announcing the unwritten prohibition publicly, disturbing the "essential appearance" of free choice.
* Referring to the forced choice ironically, as if it is an actual one.
    * But the appearance of free choice cannot be emphasized too loudly, clashing with the common knowledge that the explicit rules are not true.
* The only remaining position is that of ignoring the issue, as if we are dealing with an embarrassing public secret.

## Ideology

In "permissive" societies, ideological censorship is alive in a displaced way.
* Old solution:
    * Changing dramatic endings to happy endings.
    * BUT Ridley Scott's* Hannibal*, changing the ending from happy to dramatic.
        * Fundamental fantasy, Hannibal as object of libidinal investment.
        * The novel gets too close to our fantasmatic kernel (loving Hannibal and identifying through Clarice).
        * The prohibition of the fundamental fantasy renders the cinematic universe psychologically "tangible".
        * Fundamental fantasy is not ultimate hidden truth but the ultimate founding lie. A distance towards the fantasy, refusal to stage it directly, enables us to articulate this fantasy's falsity.

Name-of-the-Father:
* Kieslowski, *Decalogue IV*: dead mother's letter, "Father is not..."
* Symbolic function of the father is to act as a no, the agency of prohibition.
* The "real" father gives body to this symbolic function.
* The void of the *No *solicits perversions, perverse fantasies about what the person who is the bearer of this No "really wants", about the obscene enjoyment that sustains this *No*.
    * The real superego injunction is "You shall not!"
    * "You shall not kill!" is actually two parts: "You shall not!" and "Kill!"
        * Killing is the desperate response to the impenetrable abstract superego prohibition.
* Trier's *The Idiots*: the injunction to rediscover the innocence/idiocy of one's true Self.
    * Middle class actors playing a group of people who play idiocy in order to release their innocent inner idiotic Selves from bourgeois constraints.
    * Mixture of documentary and fiction releases the obscene idiocy of bourgeois existence itself.
    * Point is the impossibility (the feigned character) of every "regression" to authentic idiocy.
        * NOT we are imprisoned behind fragile masks and rituals
        * The problems is how to get rid of the apparently "superficial" mask of civilized symbolic rituals.
        * The fantasy of what is hidden behind the mask is what conceals the Real behind the mask.
            * Late Lacan, *"truth or dare"*: symbolic truth is for those who do not dare confront the fantasmatic core of the Real of their* jouissance*.
            * Truth is inoperative, doesn't matter, at the level of *jouissance*.

Trauma is never simply opposed to fantasy, uncannily is proximate.
* Always something traumatic about confronting one's fundamental fantasy
* Always something fantasmatic about trauma.
    * After horrible ordeal, the subject feels irrational guilt, ultimate proof of an unbearable *jouissance*.

Haneke, Code Unknown:
* There is no "unknown code" to be deciphered, there is no substantial psychological reality behind the masks we are wearing.
    * "There is no big Other"

Post-secular thought: "I think therefore I am" → "I am only in so far as there is someone out there who can love me".
* Being loved precedes love.
* Klein: mature person maintains reference to the sublated maternal figure as the loving background.
* Lacan: the end of the treatment is accepting "there is no big Other".
    * Traversing the fundamental fantasy equals the acceptance of the radical atheist closure.

Ideological misrecognition:
* Kangaroo, taking the question as an answer.
* Viaduct → "why a duck?"
* Question about why this name is inscribed into the name itself
    * Critique of ideology: reintroduces dimension of a question in what appears to be a positive designation.

    * The Jew, is an positive answer given instead of the questions "why are we exploited?"


Effective functioning of ideology: individuals transpose belief on to the big Other (embodied in the collective), which believes in their place so that individuals remain sane qua individuals, maintaining distance towards the "big Other" of the official discourse.
* Traditional functioning of ideology: the subject publicly claims to believe, while "in his heart of hearts" he does not believe
* Modern subject explicitly claims not to believe, while in his unconscious fantasy he does so.
* Agency of the *superego*: outcome of the failed interpellation: deep in my heart I do not believe Christianity, this awareness returns as the superego pressure of guilt.
    * BUT the superego gives expression to the guilt that pertains to the act of interpellation as such:
        * Interpellation qua symbolic identification with the Ego-Ideal is in itself a compromise.
        * Christian superego guilt functions insofar as it relies on a deeper guilt of compromising one's desire by identifying as a Christian in the first place.
        * Lacan: true formula of materialism: God is unconscious.
* Commodity fetishism, the illusion lies in our real social life and not in our perception of it: the bourgeois subject knows there's nothing magic about money, but acts in real life as if he believed that money is a magic thing.

Lacan's "God is unconscious" vs Jungian "the Unconscious is God":
* Lacan reveals the fundamental Lie that constitutes a person's fantasmatic unity: what we encounter in the innermost kernel of our being is not our true Self but the primordial lie, we all believe in the "big Other".
* Jung: Divine Truth dwells in the unexplored depths of our personality: God is the innermost spiritual substance of our being we encounter when we delve into our true Self.

Applying psychoanalysis to collective entities: the Social is not on a different level from individual experience, but something to which the individual has to relate, which the individual has to experience as an order which is minimally externalized.
* How should the decentred socio-symbolic order of institutionalized practices/beliefs be structured if the subject is to retain his "sanity", his "normal" functioning.


Cultural revolutions: depriving individuals of their support in the "big Other", in the institutional symbolic order.

## Is There a Politics of Subtraction?

Badiou: twentieth century is undermining of the big Other, "passion for the Real", trying to delivering the thing itself (New Order).
* The Real in its extreme violence as the price to be paid for peeling off the deceptive layers of reality.
    * Celebrating trench face-to-face combat as authentic intersubjective encounter.
    * Dildo camera showing inside the vagina: when we get too close to the desired object, erotic fascination turns into disgust at the Real of the bare flesh.

9/11, the split between First World and the Third World is opposition between living a long satisfying life, full of material and cultural wealth, and dedicating one's life to some transcendent Cause.
* Nietzsche: antagonism between "passive" and "active" nihilism.
* Hegelian paradox: although the West is the exploiting master, they occupy the position of the Servant who clings to life and its pleasures and cannot risk his life, while the Muslim fundamentalists are Masters ready to risk their lives.

Stalinist universe: the passion for the Real necessarily ends up in the obsession with pure appearance (show trials).
* Impossibility of drawing distinction between deceptive reality and some firm positive kernel of the Real since the Real Thing is ultimately another name for the Void.
* The only way to trace the distinction is to stage it in a fake spectacle.
    * Fundamental illusion that the violent work of purification will be followed by the ex nihilo emergence of the New Man.
        * "Really existing men" are reduced to stock of raw material.
        * Tension between the series of "ordinary" elements and the exceptional "empty" element (the Socialist "New Man").
        * No a priori positive determination of the New Man, a revolution is legitimized only negatively, a will to break with the Past.
        * Some sublime *"indivisible remainder"* (paragon of the New) will remain after the destructive work of purification

"Postmodern" passion for the semblance of the Last Men ends up in a kind of Real.
* Cutters: desperate strategy to return to the Real of the body.
    * Vs Tattoos which guarantee the subject's inclusion in the virtual symbolic order
    * Radical attempt to regain a stronghold in reality.
* Virtual Reality generalizes the procedure of offering a product derived of its substance by providing reality itself deprived of its substance, of the hard resistant kernel of the Real.
    * Decaffeinated coffee
    * By the end of the process of virtualization: reality is its own best semblance.
* Stockhausen: the planes hitting the WTC was the ultimate work of art
    * The terrorists themselves did not do it primarily to cause real material damage, but for the spectacular effect f it
    * Thrill of the Real as the ultimate "effect".
* Two sides of the passion for the Real:
    * Purification: endeavors to isolate the kernel of the Real through violent peeling-off.
    * Subtraction: starts from the Void, from the reduction of all determinate content, and tries to establish minimal difference between this Void and an element which functions as its stand-in.
        * Ranciere: politics of the empty set, supernumerary element which belongs to the set but has no distinctive place in it.
        * Ancient Greece, the demos, the excluded, presented themselves as the stand-in for the Whole of Society, for true Universality ("We --- the 'nothing', not counted in the order--- are the people, we are All against others who stand only for their particular privileged interest").
        * Balibar: *égaliberté*, principled equality of all people qua speaking beings.
        * Short circuit between the Universal and the Particular: the paradox of the singular which appears as the stand-in for the Universal, destabilizing the "natural" functional order of relations in the social body.
            * Elementary gesture of politicization
                * E.g. French Revolution:* le troisieme état* proclaimed itself identical to the Nation.
            * Politics and democracy are synonymous when antidemocratic politics aims to depoliticize (unconditional demand that things should return to normal with each individual doing his particular job).
        * **Minimal difference**: the difference between the set and this surplus-element 
            * Lack of *specific (functional) difference* which makes it an embodiment of the* pure difference* between the place and its elements.
        * Supernumerary element emerges when we pass difference → antagonism: all qualitative differences are suspended, it stands for the pure difference as such, for the non-social within the field of the social.
            * The Zero itself is counted as One.
        * How to pursue the politics of subtraction once one is in power?
            * Laclau: democracy is the politics of subtraction (Badiou, as infinite Idea).
                * The rule of One is exploded from within in democracy through the *minimal difference* between place and element: the "natural" state of every political agent is opposition and exerting power is an exception, temporary occupation of the empty place of Power.
                    * *Minimal difference* disappears in pre-modern states and in totalitarianism.
            * BUT democracy is established as a positive formal system by excluding some options as "non-democratic", this exclusion is not democratic.
                * Marx: this inclusion/exclusion is overdetermined by the fundamental social antagonism which can never be adequately translated into the form of democratic competition.
                * Democratic illusion of elections is formalist; it abstracts from the concrete framework of social relations within which the democratic form is operative.
                * Political democracy has to rely on private property
                * The problem with democracy is its "collateral damage": the fact that it is a form of State Power that involves certain relationships of production.
            * Repeating the Leninist "politics of purification" in the guise of the "politics of subtraction".
                * Stalin is Lenin's uncanny double, his obscene shadow, at which we arrive by redoubling Lenin.
                * What if the repetition of Lenin is the ultimate example of the logic of subtraction, of generating the* minimal difference*?

## Lacan and Badiou

Lacan and Badiou share the focus on the shattering encounter with the Real.
* Badiou: impasse vs passe
    * Truth is arduous work of fidelity, forcing a new law on to the situation.
    * {==Subjectivization: engagement on behalf of Truth, fidelity to the Truth-Event.==}{>>Kierkegaardian existential commitment<<}
    * Forceful transformation of the real into a consistent truth.
    * Aeschylean couple of courage and justice (Orestes)
* Lacan: traversing the fantasy, confronting fundamental impasse. We can only endure, we cannot force a passage through.
    * The ultimate truth of being is the nullity of every Truth (any ordered consistency appears to be imaginary in so far as it conceals the fundamental lack itself).
    * Experience of the Void is a traumatic encounter, not process.
    * Sophoclean couple of superego/anxiety (Oedipus, Antigone)
    * Sublimation gives being to the lack as/of the impossible Thing, object elevated to the dignity of the Thing.
        * Death drive and creative sublimation:
            * Death drive does negative work of destruction, suspending the existing order of Law, clearing the table.
            * Sublimation restarts the work of creation.

Badiou, modality of truth-procedure, ***"as if*"**
* Subjective intervention names the event and connects as many elements of the situation to this name (trace of the vanished event), forces the extended situation from the bias of the new truth *as if* the new truth were already generally applicable.
* Stalin missed the *as if* part, misreading the new truth as directly applicable to the situation, as its ontological order.
* Kant:
    * Constitutive principles: a priori
    * Regulative ideas: should be applied to reality only in the *as if* mode
        * E.g. acting *as if* reality is sustained by a teleological order; as if there is a God and an immortal soul.
    * Interminable ethical work, purity is negative measure of our everlasting impurity (finitude of human experience)
* Badiou has gap between the eternity of the idea of justice and the interminable work of forcing it into a situation.
* Truth procedure ceases for inherent reasons, not affected by the level of being, when its sequence is exhausted
    * Sequence > consequence

The preceding split between the opposition of Being and Event is within the order of Being itself: all of the multitude of Being can never be adequately represented in a State of Being and an Event always occurs at the site of this surplus/remainder which eludes the grasp of the State.
* Same gap between Kantian Thing-in-itself and our phenomenal reality.


Same problem unsolved by Badiou and Kant: *how does being appear to itself?*
Also problem in Badiou: conflicting multiplicity of States of Being, coexistence of States.

The Event is subjective (exists only for those who commit themselves to it) but it must have a status outside the circle of subjective recognition/nomination so that those within the situation from which the Event emerged who ignore the Event are also affected by it.
* *Historicity*: Adorno: "the power of the New to bind us": when something truly New emerges, we cannot go on as if it had not happened, since the very fact of this New changes all the coordinates.
* Badiou: every truth is post-evental
    * Zizek: truth is the Event's symbolization.
* Zizek: instantaneous reversal (traversing the fantasy) is only the beginning, "positing the presupposition" opens the actual work of positing.

Badiou's four discourses:
* Hysteric's discourse: new truth explodes in an event, articulated as inconsistent provocation, subject itself is blind to the true dimension.
    * "I love you!" outburst surprises even the one who utters it.
* The master's task is to elaborate the truth into a consistent discourse.
* Pervert works as if there was no truth-event, categorizes the effects as if they can be accounted in the order of knowledge.
    * E.g. explaining the French Revolution as outcome of the complexity of the French situation in 18th century, depriving it of its universal scope.
* Mystic's discourse: clinging to the pure In-Itself of the truth that is beyond the grasp of any discourse.

Difference to Lacan's discourses:
* Master vs Analyst:
    * In Lacan, it is the Master and not the Hysteric who performs the act of nomination. Master's intervention is momentary, unique, singular, transforms chaos into the New Order.
* Badiou has no place for the discourse of the Analyst, has mystical discourse instead.
    * Badiou precludes the possibility of devising a discourse which has as its structuring principle the unnameable "indivisible remainder" that eludes the discursive grasp.
        * Cannot expand the encounter with the Real into a discourse
        * If the encounter is to start to function as a discourse, has to be transposed into a Master's discourse.
* Badiou: objective-neutral Knowledge vs subjectively engaged Truth
    * Lacan adds fantasmatic kernel which cannot be subjectively assumed: it can only be retroactively reconstructed in a desubjectivized knowledge.

## Surplus-Enjoyment

The Real as an anamorphic stain:
* NOT a stain in reality
* Indicates a process of the ontological disintegration of reality itself.
* Sadeian "second death" becoming possible with technology:
    * Domain of the Undead, spectral Evil which persists beyond death.
    * Very bad people continue to haunt us after death in reality, their Evil makes them "larger than life", undead spectral entities.
    * The only way to react to the haunting paternal spectre, to the undead father, is to treat myself as if I am already dead.

Sylvia Plath, enjoying picking her nose: sinthome, is a "knot" around which varieties of* jouissance* circulate.
* In post-traditional "reflexive" societies, this enjoyment is pure form in the guise of excessive non-functional cruelty as a feature of contemporary life.
    * *Id-Evil*: Evil structured by the elementary imbalance in the relationship between the Ego and *jouissance*, by the tension between pleasure and the foreign body of *jouissance* at its heart.
        * "Short circuit" in the subject's relationship to the primordially missing object-cause of his desire: what bothers us in the other is that he appears to entertain a privileged relationship to the object (either possesses it or poses a threat to our possession of the object).
    * Global reflexivization of society.
        * ... of interpretation, ("there is no outside-of-the-text") makes the analyst's interpretation lose its "symbolic efficiency" and leaves the symptom intact in the immediacy of its idiotic *jouissance*.
        * Unconditional enjoyment "within the limits of reason alone", it is only when enjoyment is affected by the infinity of Reason that it surpasses the pragmatic limitations of pleasure, and asserts itself as pleasure-in-pain.
            * Sade as the truth of Kant, cold mechanistic combination of endless orgies is sex unconstrained by any "pathological" considerations.
* Reading ideological formation as a dream to detect ideological surplus-enjoyment.

Eastern vs Western sublime:
* Both: the uselessness of the product is the outcome of the extreme "realistic" and pragmatic approach itself.
* West: realistic advice about problems we will never encounter.
* East: unpractically complicated solutions to problems we all encounter.
# E Pluribus Unum
## 1 On the One
### I The Birth of a Master-Signifier
#### The non-analysable Slovene

Weiss, Slovene analyst writes to Freud in 1920s, Freud says common immoral man is non-analysable and at the same time it is just unethical what the man is doing.
* Similar to prohibition of incest: if something is in itself impossible, why is it necessary further to forbid it?


Everyday concept of psychoanalysis: necessary for subject to free the "internal inhibition" which blocks his access to enjoyment.
* This is insufficient, the Slovene man is immoral, has no inhibition, yet enjoyment is entirely forbidden to him, cannot enjoy.
* Lacan, inverting Dostoevsky: "If there is no God- the Name-of-the-Father as an instance of the Law/Prohibition- everything is forbidden."
    * Totalitarian political discourse: the "impediment" of the subject results from an absence, suspension, of the Law/Prohibition.
    * Enjoyment itself, experienced as "transgression", is in its innermost status something imposed, ordered. When we enjoy, we always follow a certain injunction.

Imaginary (captivation by the mirror-image, recognition in a fellow-creature) and the Symbolic (purely formal order of differential features), the specific dimension of the Symbolic emerges from the imaginary mirroring, doubling: the real image is substituted by a virtual one.
* The Imaginary is hooked on the Symbolic at a point of double reflection within the Imaginary itself.
* Hegel: the Christian notion of the Beyond is the inversion of the terrestrial life (terrestrial injustice vs There, goodness is rewarded).
    * The "first" world whose inverted image is the topsy-turvy world is already in itself inverted.
    * *Ego-Ideal*: symbolic identification is identification with the ideal ("virtual") point from which the subject looks upon himself when his own actual life appears to him as a vain and repulsive spectacle.
        * The point is virtual, cannot be located within the mirror-relationship between reality and its inverted image-, it is strictly symbolic in nature.

#### Let the Emperor have his clothes!

The subject of the signifier is constitutively split:
* I. Ignorance of her imaginary experience
* II. The way her words affect the intersubjective network; the "truth" of innocent prattle can be intersubjective catastrophe.
* These levels never fully cohere; the subject, by definition, cannot master the effects of his speech, since the big Other is in charge.

*"Who Dealt?"*
* Double reflection structure in limitation to the viewpoint of the narrator as cause of the catastrophe.
* Double reflection produces a purely virtual symbolic point: neither what I immediately see ("reality itself") nor the way others see (the "real" inverted image of reality) but the way I see the others seeing me.
    * We -audience- are set up in the position of the narrator's Ego-Ideal.
    * Hegel: we are her "In-itself or For-us"

"Instead-of" logic:
* Adorno, arriving at the "authoritarian syndrome" by inverting the features that define the ideological image of the liberal bourgeois individual.
    * Non-explicated status of the "positive" counter part to the "authoritarian personality". IS IT:
        * I. Ideal paradigm and its perverted realization: "instead of critically examining every authority, the subject uncritically obeys those in power".
        * II. "Authoritarian personality" has symptomatic value, in it the "repressed truth" of the liberal personality emerges.
            * Marx, idealist inversion of the relationship between the Universal and the Particular:
                * Common-sense nominalism (Roman law and German law as two laws) and speculative idealism (THE Law realizes itself in Roman law and in German law) could relate in I and II
                * *Alienation*: The moment invertedness is redoubled: the inversion attests to the invertedness of the "normal" state itself, the standard by mens of which we measure alienation is called into question.
            * Lacan: the subject of the signifier is a "virtual image": it exists only as a virtual point in the self-relating of the signifier's dyads; as something that "will have been", never present in its "real" (actual) image.
                * Subject as result of the way the past's mirroring in the future is mirrored back in the present.
                * E.g. my perception of the possible future outcome of my present acts determine what I will do now.
                * Invalidation of every intersubjective prognosis: the prognosis itself bears upon the predicted outcome as soon as it is enunciated, it is never able to take into account this effect of its own act of enunciation.

#### The "quilting point"

Ego-Ideal that emerges from the double reflection equals*** le point de capiton***.

The imaginary couple of miserable Earth vs blissful divine Beyond can only work with a third, properly symbolic moment of the fear of God--- the horrifying reverse of the celestial Beyond itself.
* *Imaginary*: we react to earthly fears by "have patience, eternal bliss is waiting for you in the Beyond..."
* *Symbolic*: what delivers us from earthly fears is the assurance that the only thing we have to fear is God Himself - an additional fear that retroactively cancels all the others.
    * E.g. the Jew as Hitler's point de capiton, the fascinating figure of the Jew is the product of a purely formal inversion.
    * E.g. Don Quixote, narrative character whose actual function is to represent within the diegenic space its own process of enunciation -the discursive structure of the work itself-.
    * The quilting is perceived and experienced as an unfathomable, transcendent, stable point of reference concealed behind the flow of appearances and acting as its hidden cause.
        * Modern vs traditional *allegory*:
            * Traditional: the immediate diagenic content of a work personifies transcendent values or ideas (concrete individuals stand for Evil, Wisdom etc.)
            * Modern: the diegenic content is allegory of its own immanent process of enunciation, of writing and reading.
                * E.g.* Psycho*,  allegory of the relationship between Hitchcock and the viewer: the aggression in the shower scene epitomizes Hitchcock's sadistic punishment of the viewer for his inquisitiveness.
* How is it possible that the result of a purely formal inversion acquires enough substantiality to be perceived as a flesh-and-blood personality?
    * *Enjoyment:* the only substance acknowledged by psychoanalysis. The mechanism relies on the surplus, the fact that we impute to the "Jew" an impossible, unfathomable enjoyment, allegedly stolen from us.
* Hegel: the King as point de capiton, two steps in his being the point of the "suture" of social totality:
    * I. His intervention transforms a contingent collection of individuals into a rational totality
    * II. Precisely as the point at which a cultural-symbolic function (that of being a king) immediately coincides with a natural determination (who will be king is determined by nature; by biological lineage), the King radically "desutures" all other subjects: makes them lose their roots in some pre-ordained organic social body that would fix their place in society in advance and forces them to acquire their social status by means of hard labour.
        * The only thing that actually de-sutures is suture itself.
            * Ambiguity of the modern nation:
                * I. "Nation" designates modern community delivered of the traditional "organic" ties. People as abstract individuals, not as members of particular estates etc.
                * II. There is always kind of "surplus of the Real" that sticks to it- to define itself, "national identity" must appeal to the contingent materiality of the "common roots", of "blood and soil" and so on.
                    * The new "suture" effect by the Nation renders possible the "desuturing", the disengagement from traditional organic ties.
                    * "Nation" is a pre-modern leftover which functions as an inner condition of modernity itself, as an inherent impetus of its progress.

#### "A signifier represents the subject for another signifier"

General equivalence**: "fear of God" as the general equivalent of all fears, all fears are **exchanged** against what is called the fear of God.
* Marx, commodity-form: the universal dimension of all commodities is incarnated in a sole commodity, all other commodities undergo "transubstantiation" and *start to function as the appearance of the universal Value embodied in money*.


"A signifier represents the subject for another signifier", which is S1 (Master-Signifier) and which is S2 (the chain of knowledge)?
* S1 represents the subject for S2, for the chain of signifiers which includes it.
* BUT S1, the One, is the signifier for which all the others represent the subject, in the absence of it, all the other signifiers do not represent anything.
* Differential nature of the signifier:
    * *Difference*: the opposite of one term, of its presence, is not immediately the other term but the absence of the first term, the void at the place of its inscription and the presence of the other term fills out this void of the first term's absence.
        * Structuralism: the presence of a term means the absence of its opposite.
    * The possible absence of a signifier is materialized in the presence of its opposite.
        * Matheme for this absence is $, "barred" signifier.
* Matheme for the subject: a signifier (S1) represents for another signifier (S2) its absence, its lack $, which is the subject.
    * Differential relationship only possible via the third term, the void of their possible absence.
    * "Signifier is differential" = there is no signifier which does not represent the subject.
        * But each signifier represents for the first signifier the void of its possible absence (subject).
        * No master signifier in the beginning: any signifier could assume the role if its eventual function becomes to represent a subject for another signifier.
    * The proper Master-Signifier is produced when the series of equivalences is reversed and one signifier is ascribed the function of representing the subject (the place of inscription) for all the others ("all" are totalized this way).

Articulation of the value-form from the first chapter of *Capital*:
* 1. Simple, isolated or accidental form of value: a commodity B appears as the expression of value of a commodity A.
* 2. Total or expanded form of value: Equivalences are multiplied; commodity A finds equivalences in a series of commodities B, C, D, E.
    * The subject is simultaneously represented and not represented, something remains concealed in the relationship to the signifier.
    * Subject has no proper signifier which would fully represent it, every signifying representation is a misrepresentation which always-already distorts the subject.
* 3. General form of value: we reach the level of general equivalent by reversing the total or expanded form: commodity A itself gives expression to the value of all other commodities B, C, D, E.
* Starts from the radical contradiction (use-value and exchange-value) of a commodity; a signifier and the void-place of its inscription (S/$) because of which the first aspect (use-value, signifier) must be posited as a dyad from the beginning; a commodity can express its exchange-value only in the use-value of* another *commodity.
* 2 → 3 introduces an additional* "reflective" dimension* to the economy of representation.
    * The posited "general equivalent" signifier is NOT the "proper" signifier. It is a "reflective" one: in it, the impossibility of the signifier's representation is reflected into this representation itself.
        * Functions as the* "signifier of the lack of the signifier"*, as the place of the *reflective inversion of the lacking signifier into the signifier of the lack*.
    * All signifiers represent the subject for the signifier which in advance represents for them their own ultimate failure.
        * Representation of the failure of representation
        * "Subject of the signifier" is not a positive, substantial entity persisting outside the series of its representations: it coincides with its own impossibility, it is nothing but the void opened by the failure of its representations.
    * E.g. bodhisattva: one who has attained enlightenment and can pass over into Nirvana, but the bodhisattva alone cannot actually pass over into Nirvana because he would be exhibiting a selfishness that a bodhisattva cannot have. 
        * Bodhisattva provides the contours of a "masculine", "phallic" mystical subjective position.
        * Bodhisattva functions as a "reflective", "phallic" element: he represents Liberation, stepping out of the world of illusions but not immediately. He embodies the very impossibility of the individual's immediate Liberation (he has to make the sacrifice by postponing his own entry into Nirvana for the sake of the salvation of mankind).
            * Liberation is already present in him (vs ordinary human beings) but only as a pure possibility which must forever remain postponed.
* Two stages of the "general form" (3)
    * 1. The "general equivalent "is the one which is most often exchanged, which has the greatest use value
    * 2. The "general equivalent" is taken over by a commodity with no use-value, money
        * 4. The money form
    * 1 and 2 are different level of representation: "all" represents for the One the subject, whereas the One represents for "all" the very impossibility of representation.
* 4. The money form: a (*one*) signifier *for which all the other* signifiers represent the subject.
* 4 vs 2: in 4, the multitude of others are not non-totalized collection of "others, but the totality of "all the others": the multitude is totalized through the exceptional position of the One which embodies the moment of impossibility.

Labour force: a special commodity
* Whose "use value" is labour and is a source of value.
* Labour force produces surplus-value over its own value as commodity.
* When the force which produces value exchanges itself for value, we encounter S1, general equivalent, as well as the object.
    * Surplus-enjoyment embodied in objet petit a.
    * Labour force = money is Hegelian "infinite judgement"
        * Proletariat as pure, substanceless subjectivity delivered from all substantial links with the objective conditions of production AND an entity that is for sale on the market, posited as equal to a dead piece of metal. 
        * $ lozenge a, junction of the empty subjectivity and money.
        * Marx: there is no $ without the a: the subject can arrive at its being-for-itself only by being posited as equivalent to its absolute antipodeç

#### Why is morality the darkest of conspiracies?

The Dreyfus Affair as *point de capiton*
* Specific intervention: article reinterpreting the whole affair as Jewish plot.


Elementary operation of the *point de capiton*: quid pro quo by means of which what immediately before was the source of disarray becomes proof of a triumph.
* Christianity: the Pauline break
    * The final defeat of Christ's earthly mission (shameful death on the cross between two robbers) → the very act of salvation (Christ has redeemed humankind by means of his death)
* Law and transgression:
    * Normally, law is boring and transgression (crime) is the "only possible adventure in the bourgeois world".
    * Detective stories: The detective is the agent of social justice who is the original and poetic figure, while the burglars and footpads are merely placid old cosmic conservatives.
        * Detective as the greatest adventurer and law-breaker
    * The only true transgression, the one which changes all other adventures into bourgeois pettiness, is the adventure of civilization, of the defense of the law itself.
        * Lacan: mad superegotistical law which inflicts enjoyment is the greatest transgression.
    * Law divides itself necessarily into an "appeasing" law and a "mad" law: the opposition between the law and its transgressions repeat itself inside the law itself.
    * Negation of the negation:
        * I. Opposition between the position and its negation (positive appeasing law and the multitude of its particular transgressions, crimes)
        * II. The only true transgression, true negativity is that of the law itself which changes all the ordinary criminal transgressions into an indolent positivity.
            * Self-relating negativity: external negative relationship between law and crime turns into law's internal self-negation.

### II How to Count Zero for One?

#### Derrida as a reader of Hegel

Derridian deconstruction
* NOT assertion of an all-embracing "textuality" or "writing" in which the frontiers separating literature from science etc. And science is reduced to a species of literature.
* The opposition of truth and "mere rhetoric", establishment of truth as something prior to and independent of "secondary" rhetorical effects is founded upon a radical rhetorical gesture.
    * Adorno: the supreme rhetorical gesture is that of renouncing itself, of referring to itself in a negative way ("What I will say now is not mere rhetoric, I mean it seriously...")
    * The difference between rhetoric and truth falls within the field of rhetoric.
    * "Truth" as opposed to "mere rhetoric" is nothing but rhetoric brought to its extreme, to the point of its self-negation.

Dialectical process: the moment which first appeared as the external limit of the point of departure proves to be nothing but the extreme of its negative self-relationship.

Two opposed readings of Hegelian dialectics:
* Traditional (followed by Derrida): negative particularity (crime as particular negation of the universal law) is just a passing moment of the law's mediated identity-with-itself.
* Zizek: universal law is nothing but universalized crime, crime brought to the point of self-negation, the difference crime/law falls within crime.
    * *Point de capiton*: gesture of universalization by means of which an entity turns into its opposite.

#### Identity as "reflective determination"

Two approaches to the Hegelian notion of self-identity:
* I. *Abstract identity* (excluding difference)
        * E.g. law abstractly opposed to crime, dead scheme, all effective life remains out of its reach.
    * vs *concrete identity* (includes wealth of difference, identity of the process of mediation between differences).
        * E.g. law mediated by the particularity of crime; includes crime as a sublated moment of the wealth of its content.
        * "Identity which preserves itself through the very dynamics of change.
* II. Identity-with-itself is "absolute contradiction":
    * Law in its "abstract identity" -exclusive of the particular content of crimes- is in itself supreme crime.
    * "Law is law" tautology:
        * "Law is..." is the universal law abstractly opposed to crime.
        * "...law" reveals the obscene violence, universalized crime as the first's hidden reverse.
        * Cynical wisdom that law remains a form of radical violence which must be obeyed regardless of our subjective appreciation (unfair, incomprehensible constraints).
    * Marx: Orleanists and Legitimists had to become republican one party (Party of Order).
        * "Republican" is a species of the genus royalism, the universal genus of royalism is represented in it, acquires particular existence in the form of its opposite.
        * "A royalist is a republican", "God is God":
    * Tension between* form* and *content*:
        * The form produces expectation of specific determination of the initial neutral abstract universality.
        * Form of the proposition conveys difference, content remains stuck within inert identity.
        * NOT that a genus (set) encounters itself in the shape of its own species (elements),
            * The initial moment comes across its own absence, set comes across itself as empty set.
    * Identity of opposites designates* self-reference of the Universal*: the Universal is the opposite to itself in so far as it relates to itself in the Particular,* arrives at its being-for-itself in the form of its opposite*.
    * Pure contradiction works with minimal temporality, scansion between the moment of expectation (God is...) and the moment of its disappointment (...God).

#### "God is..."

Identity of an entity with itself equals the coincidence of this entity with the empty place of its "inscription".
* When predicates fail, confrontation with the void at the point where we expect a predicate.
* *Absolute self-referential negativity; substance is subject "A = A"*
    * Subject is substance reduced to the pure point of negative relationship towards its predicates.
    * *Subject passes into predicate*:
        * Einstein's space and matter, two steps:
            * I. Matter "curves" space: matter as a substantial entity, agent independent of space which acts upon it.
                * Curvature of space as "predicate" of the matter qua substantial entity.
            * II. Matter itself is nothing but curved space.
                * The actual subject of the process is the very curvature of space.
        * Essence and appearance: the essence is nothing but the distortion of the appearance, non-adequacy of the appearance to itself.
            * Essence is nothing but the reflection-into-itself of the appearance.
        * *Speculative judgement*, as opposed to *judgement of Understanding* in which the subject qua solid, substantial entity is supplemented by predicates.
        * *Substance is the "Subject"* insofar as it remains solid, self-identical support of its "predicates".
            * Hegelian* subject* is the substantial subject which has passed into predicate.
        * Derrida's deconstruction stops by stating that identity is impossible, it is always split. Does not see the inversion of* identity qua impossible* into *identity itself as a name for a certain radical impossibility*.
            * "By way of reconciliation, the negative force recognizes in what it fights against its own force".
                * E.g. crime and law, law as universalized crime.
            * Thatcher, alien immigrants threatening British identity:
                * Deconstructivist approach: the "alien" has double status both inside element (immigrant accepts superiority of the British way of life) and outside (cancerous foreign body).
                * Hegel: the identity of the British character constitutes itself by reference to the intruder. Our identity is in itself always-already impossible, antagonistic, the threatening intruder is nothing but an outside-projection, embodiment of our own inherent antagonism.
                * Proper Hegelian-Lacanian:
                    * Thatcher, impossible conjuncture of femininity and resolute-calculating male attitude.
                    * Identity constitutes in an "impossible" coincidence of caring, law-and-order woman with the toughest possible criminal attitude.

#### A "Chiasmic exchange of properties"

Transgression of identity: deconstructing the classic literary text's identity-with-itself. Showing how it does not constitute a closed Whole but is full of flaws and elements which fill out these flaws.
* Subverting the positive consistency of Hamlet by setting free the deconstructive "power of the negative".


Identity itself as the result of a certain "transgression": the positivity of Hamlet is something that results from the self-referential activity of the "power of the negative" (contingencies).
The Familiar results from the **double estrangement**, from estrangement's self-reference.
* Starting point is the Unfamiliar
* By estranging it from itself, we find ourselves in the Familiar.
* *Reflective determination*
    * *Law* in its positive identity results from the negative self-relationship of* crime* by means of its universalization. Self-estrangement of the crime as "strange" to the law's "normality.

Warminski, "chiasmic exchange of properties", **example of *example itself***:
* First, example is external, passive resource which enables us to give plastic expression to our thought.
    * The point is not the excess of its external, particular content. An example is "just an example", draws attention to its notional kernel.
    * Classical metaphysics of meaning: inner presence-to-itself of the thought must be prevented from the false immediacy of the example.
    * Inner/active thought vs external/passive example
    * Aristotelian wax/ring example: the wax takes in only the form of the ring without the matter.
* BUT, difference between literal and proper theoretical readings of an example, short cut: the difference between the example and the notional content it is supposed to exemplify is inscribed into example itself.
    * The example is active here, generates the difference between itself and the thought, whereas the inner thought remains a passive medium that arrives at its content with the aid of its example.
* Law/thought, crime/example: the difference between the "higher" and "lower" moment is contained within the "lower" moment itself; is generated through its self-differentiation, its negative self-relationship.
* Christ as the example of example:
    * All human individuals are "exemplifications" of the divine Idea.
    * The Idea reaches its being-for-itself, actualizes itself, only by means of its embodiment in Christ.
    * The example of the example coincides with Truth itself: Christ is a point at which human example and divine Idea become indistinguishable.
    * Exterior (miserable individual Christ) is "active" in relation to the interior of the divine Idea.

#### The "logic of the signifier"

Triad: the Universal (Law) redoubles into positive and negative when confronted with its particular content (particular crimes): the initial position, "mediated" with the multitude of its particular negations, is retroactively trans-coded into pure, self-relating negativity.

A set comes across itself within its own elements --- is based on the possibility of reducing the structure of the set to a limit-case:
* Set with one element has to differ only from the empty set (the set which is nothing but the lack of the element itself). The element has to come out for the set to exist, it has to exclude itself, to except itself, to occur as deficient or in surplus.
* The specific difference is not between elements against the background of the neutral-universal set, it is between the universal set itself and its particular element (set is at the same level as its elements).
* Set is the paradoxical element which "is" the absence itself: each set comprises as one of its elements the empty set.
* Differential set of signifiers: one has to comprise in the network of differences the difference between an element and its own absence--- one has to posit the existence of a signifier which "represents" the very lack of the signifier (coincides with the place of inscription of the signifier).
    * *Self-reflective difference*: the signifier differs not only from another positive signifier but from itself as signifier.

First, we have the abstract Universal. Since it is abstracted from a set of particular entities, we apprehend how the Universal is already in itself particular: the Universal is not "all", what escapes it is the Particular itself.
* "Missed" encounter between the Universal and the Particular:
    * The Particular is always deficient and/or in excess with regard to its Universal.
        * Deficient: there is never enough of the Particular to "fill out" the Universal frame.
        * In excess: the Universal -insofar as it is abstract- cannot encompass it.
* Successful encounter would have no remainders, but there is always the remainder of the empty place occupied by the surplus element which is the set itself in the form of its opposite, the empty set.
* *Logic of "non-All"*: transforming a collection of particular elements into a consistent totality requires positing as an exception a paradoxical element which embodies the universality of the genus in its very particularity (in the form of universality's opposite).
    * The split/division is located on the side of the Universal, not on the side of the Particular:
        * NOT the diversity of particular content introducing division, specific difference, into the neutral frame of the Universal.
        * The Universal itself is constituted by way of subtracting some Particular designed to embody the Universal as such.
            * The Universal is posited in its being-for-itself in the act of radical split between the wealth of particular diversity and the element which "gives body" to the Universal.
* *Logic of sexual difference*: the set of women is a particular, non-totalized, non-universal set: the dimension of universality ("humankind" comes when one excludes from it an element which embodies humankind as such: man.
    * The genus of "man" has one species, woman.
    * The universality of "humankind" is posited as such through the inscription of sexual difference.
    * "Man" qua male gives body to the universality of man qua human being in the form of its opposite; insofar as it immediately embodies humankind, man qua male is radically more "inhuman" than woman.
        * *"Woman doesn't exist"*:
            * "Existence" not synonymous with "being".
            * "Existence" corresponds to *"Ground"*: existence is being insofar as it is "grounded", founded in a unique universal Ground acting as its *"sufficient Reason"*.
            * Woman doesn't possess a unique Ground, cannot be totalized with reference to some encompassing Principle.
* *Overdetermination*: a totality which always comprises a particular element embodying its universal structuring principle.
    * Marx: production is a species which encompasses its own genus (the totality of production, distribution, exchange and consumption).
    * *Antithetical determination*: the surplus element embodies the Universal in its negative form.
* Hegelian "holism" ("the True is the Whole") is of a "self-referential" kind: the Whole is always-already part of itself, comprised within its own elements.
    * Mechanism of dialectical "progress" is 
        * NOT gradual ramification of some initially non-differentiated totality into a network of concrete determinations.
        * A Whole adding itself again and again to its parts.

#### The subjectivized structure

The signifier's structure* subjectivizes* itself by way of the surplus element which embodies the Universal in its negative form.
* Subject exists only within the "failed encounter" between the Universal and the Particular.
    * Subject is a name for their constitutive discord.
* Classification where the Universal is divided into species without the remainder of its antithetical determination is an "objective" structure, does not stage the representation of the subject.

Antithetical determination = "signifier which represents the subject for the other signifiers"?
* *NO*, where is the dialectic of lack and excess?
    * Surplus Particular comes in excess insofar as it fills out the lack of the Particular with regard to the Universal.
    * Surplus is the form of appearance of the lack.* **The One (plus-One) is the form of appearance of Zero.*
    * Hegel: "*I* *have* determinate notions, but the *I is the pure Notion* itself which has come into *existence* as Notion.
        * I (subject) is located at the crossing point of "being" and "having".
        * "I" is BOTH pure negative universality which repels all determinate content AND abstract power of negativity which has come into existence in the domain of its determinations, which has acquired "determinate-being".
            * *Opposite of universal self-identity*: it is a vanishing point, the "other-of-itself" eluding every determination: *pure singularity*.
            * "Absolute universality which is also immediately an absolute individualization (singularity)".
                * Ultimate identity of the* I *and the* Notion*.

**The Void itself filled out by the Exception** is the** fourth term** to be added to the positive Universal, the Particular, and the Exception which embodies the Universal in the form of its opposite.
* Subversion of the "principle of identity": identity-with-itself as expressed in tautology (God is God) is in itself the purest absolute contradiction, the lack of any particular determination.
* Tautology opens up a void in the Substance which is then filled out by the Exception: *the void is the subject*, and the Exception represents it for all other elements of the Substance.

Dialectical process starts with the absolute contradiction: the pure difference is always-already the impossible "predicate" of identity-with-itself.
* Lacan: the identity of a signifier's mark (S) always-already represents the subject ($).
* Absolute contradiction resolved by excluding from the substantial set "at least One" which remarks the void of their space of inscription.
    * Subject is this void, *the mediating fourth term which vanishes* in the final Result, in the accomplished Triad.

#### The "metaphor of the Subject"

Lacan: the status of the subject is linked to **a metaphoric substitution**.

* First, two complementary readings:
    * I. Subject as the last, ever-elusive Signified. There is no "proper" signifier to the subject, every signifier can only serve as its metaphor. Subject is always hinted at between the lines.
        * Substance
    * II. A signifying chain is "subjectivized" by way of its metaphoricity: subject is the name for the gap that prevents human language from becoming neutral tool for designation of some objective state of things. Our speech is "subjectivized" insofar as it never "says directly what it wants to say".
        * Subject
* *Republicanism* in which *royalism* encounters itself in the form of its opposite as *a metaphoric substitution* for royalism (republicanism taking over the place of royalism-in-general).
* *The Exception has two faces:*
    * I. *Metonymic* relationship towards* the universal genus (substantial Object)*; in it, a part functions as a metonymic substitute for the Whole.
        * E.g. Production as a term which stands for the Whole tetrad.
    * II. *Metaphoric** *relationship towards* the void (subject)*: the Exception fills out the void in the midst of the Substance.
        * The act by means of which Zero is counted as One (the One stands for the Zero).
        * Lacan: subject is a Nothing which is already "counted as One", remarked by the Exception; a Nothing which appears in the form of its opposite, of One.
* "Original metaphor" is
    * NOT substitution of "something for something-else"
    * Substitution of *something for nothing*
* *Metonymy is a species of metaphor:* metonymic sliding from one partial object to another is set in motion by the metaphoric substitution constitutive of the subject: the "one for another" presupposes the "one for nothing".

#### The Hegelian "one One"

Determinate-being** \[*Dasein*\] passes into **being-for-self** \[*Fürsichsein*\] and **being-for-one** \[*Sein-für-Eines*\].
* Inquiring the quality of a thing: "What for one thing is this?", which is this One* for which *something is?
    * This One cannot coincide with Something
        * Finite reality, something is always "mediated" by other "somethings", the being of Something is always a *being-for-other *[*Sein-für-Anderes*].
        * The One is only when the something-other (for which something is) is reflected into the thing itself as its own ideal unity: *being-for-self*.
            * The One denotes the ideal unity of a thing beyond the multitude of its real properties.
            * The thing as element of reality is sublated in the One.
    * Something → One = reality → ideality: the One for which the thing qua real is is this thing itself in its ideality.
        * Intervention of the symbolic order: Passage only possible when the One is embodied, materialized, externalized in its signifier.
            * The thing is sublated in its symbol which posits it as One: reduces it to a {==unitary feature==}{>>Trait unaire?<<} designated by its signifying mark.
            * Passage entails decentering of the thing with regard to itself: its most intimate kernel of identity is posited only externalized in arbitrary signifying mark.
            * *Being-for-self equals the being of a thing for its symbol*: the thing is "more itself" in its external, arbitrary symbol than in its immediate materiality.
* What is the correlate of One?
    * *Void*; cannot be something-other since the One is already in unity of itself with its Other, the One is the "inherent" Other for which the thing is.
    * If the One is Something reflected-into-self, the Void is the reflection-into-self of the Otherness --- "pure" Otherness which is no longer* Something*-other.
* *Void and the One*:
    * The Void is NOT external to One.
    * The One itself is "void"; the Void is its only "content".
        * Logic of the signifier:
            * One is the "pure signifier", "signifier without signified", refers only to the object's pure notional Unity brought about performatively by this signifier itself.
                * E.g. proper names
            * *The Void is the signified of the pure signifier, the subject of the signifier.*
* One of quality → One of quantity
    * One of quality (le trait unaire) is required to count and say "here is one One, here is the second One, here the third..."
    * With this passage,* Void → Zero*

Being and Nothing:
* No difference in content.
* Being is the first determination-of-form the truth of which is nothing ---pure lack of any determinate content.
* Being vs Nothing; contradiction between "content" and "form" at its purest.
    * Being's form possesses a determination of "something", yet its content is "nothing".
        * Nothing counted as Something.
    * Absolute contradiction is "repressed" into a timeless past (Schelling, antagonism of drives).
        * "Being *has passed* over into Nothing", NOT "passes over"
        * Something is the unity of Being and Nothing that "came to be"
            * Only with Something do we start to think. Being and Nothing are the absence of determination conceived *from within the field of notional determination*.

## 2 The Wanton Identity

### I Impossibility

#### Hegel's "monism"

Adorno's fetishistic disavowal: I know very well that Hegel asserts difference and negativity; nevertheless... by means of the Notion's self-relation, this negativity is ultimately reduced to an abstract moment of the Identity's self-differentiation.
* "*Je sais bien, mais quand meme...*"
* Fear of "absolute knowledge", prohibition of the impossible: "absolute knowledge" is impossible Ideal, for this reason we must fight its temptation.
    * "Absolute knowledge" as the{== Real ==}{>>Constructing impossible theoretical position they must presuppose to define their own position by distancing from it, Real as construction: “non-constructive proof” in mathematics.<<}of its critics

Hegel subverts "monism"; the Idea recollects-internalizes (sublates) all particular determinations but there is a remainder of the dialectical process which resists sublation-internalization while being the condition of its possibility at the same time.

"Sublation of the difference" ends in the experience of how *the difference was always-already sublated; it never effectively existed.*
* *"Sublation" is retroactive "unmaking"*; there never was an obstacle to Unity, the appearance of an "obstacle" was due only to our wrong "finite" perspective.
    * The aim of punishment is to assert how, in a radical ontological sense, the crime did not exist at all: by means of the punishment, crime is posited as something that is already in itself ontologically null, crime is nothing but a null and void semblance.
    * Derrida: "metaphysics of presence" is paradoxical when faced with "supplement" phenomena (e.g. writing; writing is external to the inner presence of meaning, it does not concern its constitution; writing threatens to obscure the intelligibility of the intention-of meaning)
        * Hegel: YES please, that which functions within the traditional metaphysics as a symptom is the fundamental and explicit thesis: one has to fight crime precisely because it has no ontological consistency.

#### The "silent weaving of the Spirit"

The process of change of "contents" comes before the formal closing act (structural necessity of the** delay**).
* "Things happen before they effectively happen"
* "Word of reconciliation" is purely formal act, stating what has already taken place.
* "Silent weaving of the Spirit": unconscious transformation of the entire symbolic network. When the work is done (*"in itself"* is already decided), it is time for formal act by means of which the previous shape of the Spirit breaks up also *"for itself"*.
    * Consciousness always comes too late.
    * Lacanian *"in-between-two-deaths"*: the "shape of consciousness" is already dead without knowing it and it is still alive only because it doesn't know it is dead.
    * An ideological battle is won when the adversary himself begins to speak our language, without being aware of it.
* The final decision has the form of asserting that all is already decided.
* Psychoanalyst's ability to recognize the moment when the "silent weaving" has already done its work, although the patient is still beset by doubts and uncertainties.

#### "From nothingness through nothingness to nothingness"

Hegel's supposed ontological evolutionism: development is explication of what the thing already is "in itself", extern realization of its inner potential. The circle of dialectical development is closed, the seed is "in itself" already the tree.
* NEED to introduce dimension of radical negativity: the "truth of any particular/determined thing lies in its self-annihilation.
    * A thing reaches its truth by means of sublating its immediate being, step towards truth implies by definition a loss of being.
    * Dialectical process takes place "between two deaths", an entity "becomes what it is" by realizing its inherent negativity--- taking cognizance of its own death.
    * "Nothingness" reached at the end of the process is name for the fact that "Notion doesn't exist" (the big Other doesn't exist), it is a dead, purely formal structure without substantial content.
    * Negative relationship between knowledge and being.
        * Hegelian identity of Reason and Actuality:
            * Actuality in itself is null, it "exists" insofar as it is grounded in the notional structure (structured through Reason)
            * Hegel is anti-Plato: no substantial Notion. All that "effectively exists" is extra-notional Nature and History; Notion is nothing but their pure logical structure without substantiality.
        * "Absolute knowledge" implies recognition of absolute impossibility of accordance between knowledge and being.
        * Reversing Kant's formula of the transcendental conditions of possibility:
            * Every positively given object is possible, emerges only against the background of its impossibility, can never fully "become itself" or achieve full identity with itself.
            * No object is ever "true, this discord is a positive condition of the object's ontological consistency,
                * NOT because the Notion is an Ideal never to be achieved by an empirical object.
                * Because Notion itself partakes of the dialectical movement.
                    * As soon as an object comes too close to its Notion, the proximity displaces the Notion itself.
                        * Surplus is on the side of the example, not on the side of the ideal Notion.
                    * E.g. three steps of the "absolute Spirit": art, religion, philosophy:
                        * Art: a form of art in total accordance with the Notion of art -Idea appears unmutilated in the medium of the senses- would no longer be art but already religion
                        * Religion: the measure of truth, Notion, changes.
                            * Religion is "more Art than Art itself".
                        * Philosophy is nothing but a form of religion which corresponds to its Notion.

#### The condition of (im)possibility

The "One" of Hegel's "monism" is a paradoxical "One" of radical negativity which forever blocks the fulfilment of any positive identity.
* *"Cunning of Reason"* destroys the object by allowing the object to freely evolve its potential and to arrive at its Truth.
    * A true Master is he who can provoke the other to transform himself through his act.
    * Cunning takes into account the split that is ontologically constitutive of the other; the fact that the other never fully corresponds to its Notion.
    * Lacan: the position of the psychoanalyst is that of the Hegelian Sage.

Derridean deconstruction: the "infrastructural" condition of possibility of an entity is at the same time the condition of its impossibility, its identity-with-itself is possible only against the background of its self-relationship ---minimal self-differentiation which opens a gap hindering its full identity-with-itself.
* Also in Hegel; what at first appeared as a "condition of impossibility" to the realization of our potential is the condition of possibility of our ontological consistency.
* Dialectics of *"Beautiful Soul"*:
    * It overlooks the way the Beautiful Soul itself is an accomplice in the disorder of the world it bemoans.
    * Dissidence in "real socialism", lives for the moment when "the mask will fall off" and it will become evident that the adversary is the same old totalitarian Party.
        * The real "object of desire" of such a "dissident" is NOT to defeat the adversary, but one's own defeat (I have to lose since this is the only way to demonstrate that I was right in my accusations against the enemy).
            * Official desire is for the Communist Party to change into a democratic partner and rival.
            * My real desire is for the Party not to change; to remain totalitarian.
        * "By way of reconciliation, the negative force recognizes in what it fights against its own essence": {==the negative force of "dissidence" must recognize in the monster of the "Party" an entity which hangs its own ontological consistency, an entity that confers meaning upon its activity--- its essence.==}{>>Anarchists? Lenin was right?<<}
            * Jon Elster's *"states that are essentially by-products"*: insofar as "actuality is rational", it is the external, social realization of our intentions that testifies to their true meaning--- when we realize our intention, we are confronted with its "truth".
                * Lacan: the speaker receives from the other his own message in its inverted -its true- form.
                * Truth is always the truth of the symbolic "big Other"; it results from the way my activity is inscribed in the "public" field of intersubjective relations.

### II Reflection

#### The logic of re-mark

The crucial gesture of the dialectical approach is to exhibit the "positive" (enabling, "productive") dimension that pertains to the Negative as such; to grasp how what appeared at first a purely negative (impeding) agency functions as a positive "condition of possibility" of the entity it impedes.
Constituted through the reflexive self-relationship of the Negative.

Derrida: writing as "supplement":
* I. Writing as secondary externality which does not affect the inner presence of the Idea
* II. Uncanny proximity, the inner essence is always-already affected, constituted, by the process of writing; we need to repeat the exclusion of writing within the Idea itself.

Hegel vs Derrida: 
* Hegel's dialectics is the culmination of the metaphysics of presence, the logical machine of Notion which sublates all heterogeneity, closed circle of teleological movement.
* Derrida: irreducible dissemination of the process of **differance**; impossibility of ever enclosing the process within the circle of self-mediated identity.
    * Proximity of the self-differentiation process of the notion and the movement of differance, their delimitation must be repeated ---fetishistic disavowal.
        * First one imputes to Hegel an oversimplified notion of dialectical reflection ("reappropriation of the double as the negative of what is doubled"); then one states as a condition of such a reappropriation the elementary dialectical insight that an entity can refer to itself only by doubling itself in an Other.
* Hegel vs Derrida in *sublation*:
    * First they are opposed:
        * Hegelian sublation names the overcoming of differences, Notion encompasses heterogeneity by transforming it into an ideal-sublated moment of its own identity, differences are recognized qua moments of an articulated totality.
        * Derrida emphasizes "infrastructural" remainder which resists sublation, persists in heterogeneity and is the limit of sublation, rock on which sublation necessarily founders, its positive condition.
    * Second, opposition becomes blurred: "Re-mark" is indistinguishable from sublation.
        * *Mark → remark*:
            * Differential character of the texture of marks: this differentiality must be brought to its self-reference: every series of marks must contain an additional tropological movement by which the same mark refers to what demarcates the marks, to the blanks between the marks that relate the different marks to each other.
                * Empty mark which remarks the differential space of the inscription of marks.
            * *"Logic of the signifier"*: every series of signifiers must contain a paradoxical surplus-element which holds the place, within the series, of the very absence of the signifier.
                * Signifier of the lack of the signifier (S1)
                * The empty place represented by the re-mark is *the subject of the signifier.*
            * In *art*, paradoxical inversion by means of which what at first appears as motif (figure) retroactively -after being re-marked by a new motif (figure)- changes into accompaniment (ground): also complementary inversion where "mere accompaniment" changes retroactively into the principal motif.
                * E.g. Escher's graphic paradoxes: Subject is the inconsistency of the structure--- the void, invisible and impossible gap between the lowest and the highest step bridged by optical illusion.
                * E.g. Mozartian procedure in which the initial melody is joined by another melodic line which descends "from above" and changes the status of the first melody retroactively into that of an "accompaniment".
                    * Lost on Beethoven
                * E.g. Hitchcock's *The Birds*; first, establishing shot of the whole town taken from a "neutral" objective point of view, is subjectivized and proved to be the threatening view of the birds themselves of their victims.
        * *Re-mark and sublation*: an element is "sublated" when it is re-marked by a new frame, included in a new symbolic network, "elevated" into its element.
            * The thing remains the same qua mark, yet it is re-marked in a different way.
            * Dialectical inversion always follows the logic of re-mark: the thing itself in its immediacy does not change, only the modality of its inscription in the symbolic network changes.
                * *Re-mark* coincides with the Lacanian *S1, quilting point*.
                    * Saint Paul's rereading of the death of Christ: "reconciliation" consists in a reversal of perspective by means of which we perceive how the scission is in itself already reconciliation: in order to accomplish "reconciliation", we do not have to "overcome" the scission, we just have to *re*-mark it.
            * Derrida: self-reflexive character of "textuality"--- every texture of marks necessarily "reflects" into itself its own space of inscription, its own conditions of possibility in the shape of its opposite.
            * How to distinguish the logic of re-mark and the reflexive movement of *Aufhebung*?
                * Gasche: self-reflection is "embedded" in infrastructural mechanisms which exceed it.
                * BUT Derrida says these infrastructural mechanisms "live only by that representation": the very textuality of the text is sustained by this self-reflection.
                    * "Textuality" is nothing but a name for this process of textual self-reflection; process of re-marking.

#### The abyss re-marked

Gasche's argument:
* Movement of reflection--- reflexive totalization, its agent 'dominates' the entire chain and 'reappropriates' the reflected contents.
* Derridian re-mark: the element through which textuality reflects itself within the text never 'dominates' the chain since it occupies itself the position of one of its elements and is thus remarked anew by other elements.
    * Leveling re-mark with other marks, reduction of re-mark to a mere semic function.
    * There is always an excess of re-mark which eludes dialectical totalization; re-mark as limit to all coinciding reflection or mirroring. There is always more than totality for structural reasons.
        * Totalization never totalizes all, it is accomplished by means of an excess which remains non-totalized, non-accounted-for: no totalization which would comprise itself, its own re-mark (would re-mark itself and thus achieve transparent self-coincidence).

BUT **Hegel's deduction of monarchy from his philosophy of right** is an "empirical refutation" of this argument:
* To be effective, the unity of the State must be embodied in an individual in whose existence alone Will exists for itself--- achieves immediate existence--- and this demand for natural immediacy is best met by lineage.
* Constitutional monarchy is rationally articulated organic Whole at the head of which there is an "irrational" element, the person of the King.
    * Abyss separating the State as a organic rational totality from the irrational *factum brutum* of the person who embodies supreme power--- *by means of which the State assumes the form of subjectivity*.
    * Hegel: in a well-organized monarchy, the objective aspect belongs to law alone, *the monarch's part is merely to set to the law the subjective "I will".*
        * The act of the monarch is of a purely formal nature.
        * Monarch functions as a "pure" signifier; signifier-without-signified. His actuality consists in his Name.
            * Function of the Master-Signifier; the One of Exception, irrational protuberance of the social edifice which transforms the amorphous mass of "people into a concrete totality of mores.
            * Irrational surplus as a condition of the rational totality.
    * {==One maintains the gap between State employees who must obtain their post by hard effort, by proving themselves worthy of it, and the monarch himself as the point of pure authority of the signifier.==}{>>Inverse of RTE?<<}
    * Coincidence of pure Culture (empty signifier) with the leftover of Nature (the family of the prince is the only positive family, others are dispossessed) in the person of the king; paradox of the king's relationship towards law: the king cannot break the law since his word immediately makes law.
        * Wittgenstein, sceptical paradox: we cannot say that his act violates the Rule since it (re)defines it.
        * All other subjects are divided between their pathological reality and what they are ought to be, never correspond to their Notion.
        * The monarch immediately IS the actuality of his own Notion; Thing which acquired phenomenal existence: although he is not it, the subjects are obliged to act *AS IF* he is the Thing.
    * Maintaining the greatest gap between the Master's symbolic legitimation and the level of "effective" qualifications, localizing the function of the Master outside the Whole, reduced to purely formal decision.
        * Ronald Reagan
    * **Separation** between S1 and a:
        * Illusion of **concommitance** of S1 and a (that Master-Signifier covers the precious object)
        * S1 is imbecilic tautology of an empty name
        * The object (body of the monarch) is pure excrement, remainder appended to the Name.

#### From failed reflection to reflected failure

Hegelian monarch falls out from the dialectical mediation of Nature and Spirit; point of immediate passage, the pure Name immediately clings to the "last residue" of positive naturalness (to what is NOT* aufgehoben*).
* Failure of dialectical mediation (what the Derridean "deconstruction" brings out), "irrational" residue of non-mediated Nature (monarch's body)
    * The re-mark's presence hinders the other marks from coinciding with themselves: the identity-with-itself of a re-mark embodies negativity inherent to all marks.
    * Reflection always fails, any positive mark included in the series could never "successfully" represent/reflect the empty space of the inscription of marks.
        * This failure as such "constitutes" the space of inscription.
        * The place of inscription of marks is nothing but the void opened by the failure of the re-mark.
        * The act of reflection as failed constitutes retroactively that which eludes it.
            * Gasche: *Aufhebung* fails because
                * Excess of the "infrastructure" which can never be mirrored within the text
                * Excess of the figure of Aufhebung which can never totalize itself.
            * Two excesses are two aspects of the same gesture: the unattainable excess of the "infrastructure" constitutes itself by means of the Aufhebung as "unaccountable".
                * *Absolute reflection*: redoubled reflection: reflective re-marking of the very surplus that escapes reflection.
                * The repressed and the return of the repressed.
        * EVERY identity-with-itself is nothing but the "semic substitute for the spaced-out semiopening that makes it possible", is the inverted representative of the space of its own condition of (im)possibility.
            * "One too many" is the One as such; the One is "originally" one-too-many, the signifier-One whose signified is Void.

#### The tain of the mirror

Gasche: At the point where the mirror does not return the image, limiting reflection, the point creates the minimal distance between what is being mirrored and its mirror-image, the distance which makes mirroring possible.

* BUT, at the point of "absolute strangeness", the subject of the signifier ($) is inscribed into the picture.
    * The subject qua subject of the look "is" only insofar as the mirror-picture is inherently "incomplete", contains a "pathological" stain. The subject is correlative to this stain.
    * External → absolute reflection: redoubling of reflection: the proper dimension of the subject is "reflected" in the residue escaping the reflective grasp.
        * "The Absolute is always-already with us":
            * Our experience of the "loss", of the fissure between the subject and the Absolute is the very way the Absolute is already with us.
            * The appearance of the inaccessible Absolute makes sense only insofar as the subject's gaze is already there.
                * The In-itself is in-itself **for** the subject.

# Dialectics and its Discontents
## 3 Hegelian Llanguage
### I WITH AN EYE TO OUR GAZE
#### How to do a totality with failures
Post-modern alternative of dialectical **totalization** ("mediating" the heterogeneous elements we encounter, positing them as ideal moments of a rational totality) and **dissemination** (we are condemned to an interplay of fragments that can never be totalized).
* Falsifies the choice by misrepresenting the authentic Hegelian notion of a rational totality.
    * Hegel's wager concerns *"squared totalization"*: possibility of "making a system" out of the very series of failed totalizations, to enchain them in a rational way, discern the "logic" that regulates the process which breaks down a totalization and begets another totalization.
        * *Phenomenology of Spirit* presents a series of aborted attempts by the subject to define the Absolute and arrive at the synchronism of subject and object.
            * The true Absolute is nothing but the logical disposition of its previous failed attempts to conceive the Absolute.
                * Truth itself coincides with the path towards Truth.
        * *Class struggle*; does not totalize society, but society is held together by the antagonism that prevents its closure in a rational Whole.
            * In its absence, class struggle functions as a point of reference to conceive social phenomena as attempts to conceal the rift of class struggle.
                * Structural-dialectical paradox of an effect which exists only in order to efface the causes of its existence.
            * *Class struggle is the Subject of history*, Universal insofar as it has a negative relationship towards its particular content, it is the limit that eludes its particular effects.
                * *Substance* is the Universal qua positive space of mediation of history's particular content, receptacle containing particular wealth.
        * Non-historical kernel of the Real vs historical ways of conceiving it
            * Hysteria is the subject's way of resisting the historically specified form of symbolic identification.
                * *Ahistoric* kernel of the Real is still present, *historicism* which relativizes historical content evades the encounter with the Real.
            * Psychosis is *unhistorical*
                * Maintenance of external distance from the symbolic order.
* University discourse way of totalizing Heidegger or Lacan fails because it evades the encounter with the Real according to which every phase of Heidegger is another attempt to encircle the same kernel, "Thing of thought".
    * **Historicity** (vs historicism) presupposes some traumatic kernel which endures as "the same".
* Reproach to Freud: the Other is diverse, primitive societies did not have patriarchal family that is referenced by the Oedipus complex.
    * This approach AVOIDS calling into question our own position, the place from which we ourselves speak.
    * *Diversity of the Other* is a fetish for retaining the unproblematic identity of our subjective position (our position is decentered from within).
    * Different particular ways of family structures is only attempts to master the traumatic kernel of "*Oedipus complex*" (trauma of prohibition on which the social order is based).
    * "Understanding the Other" is preventing encounter with the Real.
        * Encounter with the Real is when we recognize that which is "in more than ourselves" in the deadlock because of which the Other failed.
* Reducing the past to the present opens historical distance to us.
    * Brecht, The Affairs of Mr Julius Caesar
    * Projecting into the past the contemporary image of the past.

#### The speculative (lack of) identity

Speculative identity**: Gillian Rose: the mark of identity between the subject and predicate designates only the specific modality of their lack of identity.
* Identity of religion and state: statement not of facts but values (Ought, *Sollen*)
    * The ideal state would be a state founded in religion and existing states can only approach this.
    * In existing states, the deficiency of Christian content is *redoubled*; the inadequacy of the actual state to the Christian religion qua its foundation corresponds to and has its ground in the inadequacy of the Christian religion itself to its own Notion.
        * *Deficiency "reflected-into-itself"*
        * Speculative identity in the overlap of the two lacks
        * State and Religion are identical *per negationem*: their identity consists in the correlation of their lack of identity with the inherent lack of the central term that grounds their relationship.
    * The relationship of the Idea to its particular actualizations is a negative one (logic of **Sollen** --- *infinite approach to the unattainable Idea)
        * Already in Kant-Fichte, but they miss that the very series of failed attempts to embody religion in the constitution of the State presents the actuality of their speculative identity.
            * As in Lacan's subject of the signifier; every signifier misrepresents the subject, but the subject has no ontological consistency outside the series of signifying misrepresentations, its identity consists in its lack of identity.
                * Subject of the signifier is the name for a limit missed by every signifying representation constituted retroactively by the failure of representation.
        * E.g. Oedipal parricide, act of which every human being is guilty as a being-of-language, since we are only able to speak under the paternal metaphor (the dead father returns as his Name).
            * "Sentiment of guilt" over particular crimes is a stratagem to deceive the big Other ---divert attention from the real crime.
            * Particular crime conceals the Universality of Crime *kat' exochen*.
            * Universal and the Particular: the Particular disavows and subverts the Universal whose exemplification it is.
        * Lacan: the Universal is real: it is not a pacifying medium that unites particularities but the unfathomable limit that prevents the Particular from achieving identity with itself.
            * Not only as Substance, but equally as Subject: the "content" of the Substance consists in the series of failed, distorted ways the Substance misrecognizes itself.
            * Commonsense "subjective"/distorted, "Substance as Subject": non-truth, error, is inherent to Truth itself: "Substance is untrue as Subject".
* *Speculative identity of Substance and Subject*: their lack of identity is correlative to the inherent non-identity, split of the Substance itself.
    * Kafka's *Trial*; Door; the external gaze of the Subject upon the inscrutable Substance is from the beginning included in the Substance itself as an index of its disparity with itself.
    * *External reflection* misses that its externality to the Substance is a self-alienation of the Substance itself, the way Substance is external to itself.
        * E.g. atomized bourgeois individual and the impenetrable Entity of Society
            * His externality to Society is a product of Society, of the way Society is reduced to a network of abstract individuals held together by external, mechanical coercion, not yet Society consistent with its notion.
    * The surplus of the Substance eluding the Subject's grasp results from an illusion of perspective: from the Subject's forgetting to include his own gaze in the picture.
        * E.g. *The French Lieutenant's Woman*, Sarah's enigma is staged in order to fascinate the hero's gaze.
    * Reversal of transcendence into immanence
        * The spectacle of Mystery is staged for the "nothing" of the Subject's gaze.
            * Lacan: *the subject's desire is the desire of the Other: *New Zealand dancing tribe, the explorers receive their own desire from the aborigines.
    * *Two illusions inverse of each other*: 1. Thing indifferent to our gaze, 2. The Other always-already looks at us, addresses us (interpellation).
        * We misrecognize the contingency of finding ourselves at the place of interpellation; how our spontaneous perception that the Other has chosen us as its addressee results from the retroactive inversion of *contingency into necessity*.
            * Interpellation: We perceive ourselves as chosen because we recognized ourselves in the call- the contingent act of recognition engenders retroactively its own necessity
            * Kafka: the Other induces us to believe that we were not chosen, the addressee mistakes his position for that of an accidental bystander.
        * *Both: the subject posits the Other*
            * Psychoanalysis: the analysand posits the Other (analyst) as "the subject supposed to know", and the analyst's neutrality serves to deny expectation of symbolic identification, *forcing the analysand to confront his own act of presupposing the Other.*

#### Llanguage and its limit

Hegelian distinction between **boundary and limit**:
* Boundary is the external limitation of an object, its qualitative confines which confer its identity (an object is "itself" within these confines).
* Limit results from a "reflection-into-itself" of the boundary when the determinatedness is reflected into the object and assumes the shape of its own unattainable limit, of what the object can never fully become, of what it can only approach into bad infinity.
    * What the object *ought* to become (although it never actually *can*).
    * Every boundary proves itself a limit in the course of the dialectical progression; the condition of possibility of identity is simultaneously its condition of impossibility.
        * E.g. national identification
            * First, identity is defined through differences from other nations (external border).
            * But who are the real Englishmen?
                * Nobody is, every empirical Englishman contains something "non-English".
            * Englishness becomes an "internal limit" preventing empirical Englishmen from achieving full identity-with-themselves.
* E.g. traditional art vs modern art:
    * Traditional: presents well-rounded organic Whole, boundary separating it from its Outside.
    * Modern: internalizes the external boundary which starts to function as limit: the work of art can no longer attain its organic roundedness ("fully become itself"); it bears the mark of failure and the Ought (Sollen)--- it is ethical.

Lacanian** *llanguage (lalange)** *is barred by an inherent limit which prevents it from constituting itself as a consistent Whole.
* Non-all totality, inconsistent.
* Logical sequence is reversed;* llanguage is logically "primordial*"; the way to make out of inconsistency a closed totality is to exclude its inherent limit into an external boundary.
    * Every Whole is founded on a constitutive Exception: what we can never obtain is a complete set of signifiers without exception, since the very gesture of completion entails exclusion.
* Paradox of the logic of the signifier: we constitute a Totality from a non-all, non-universal collection by subtracting from it the excessive "besides" the exclusion of which opens up the totality of "all things possible".
    * E.g. Truth: it is "all" only insofar as it is conceived as *adequatio* to an external object-boundary. To say that Truth is "non-all" is saying that it does not consist in an external relationship of the proposition to some external measure; that it is an immanent effect of the signifier.
* The signifier relates only to itself since it lacks an external support.
    * *Arbitrariness *has to do with external boundary with reference to which signs are "arbitrary" ("reality", "immediate-sense-data" etc.). When the boundary disappears, we have a *differential* order which is a vicious circle.
    * A signifier is only its difference towards other signifiers, can never form a consistent Whole.
        * Doomed to turn in a circle, striving to attain itself as *pure difference*.
        * The inaccessible is the pure signifier, the difference separating and constituting signifiers, their inter-diction.
* *The boundary of the sign is the "thing", the limit of the signifier is the "pure" signifier itself.*
    * *Reality is the external boundary of language whereas the Real is its inherent limit. *
    * The bar that separates the Symbolic and the Real is internal to the Symbolic since it prevents the Symbolic from "becoming itself".
* The signifier always-already goes wrong in relation to itself, and the object inscribes itself in the blank opened by this failure.
    * The positivity of the object is nothing but a positivization of the bar which prevents the signifier from fully "becoming itself".
        * "*Woman doesn't exist*": Woman qua object is nothing but the materialization of a certain bar in the symbolic universe.

#### The squabble about All

One interpretation of Don Giovanni is a primordial force that threatens the very consistency of the social edifice.
* Kierkegaard: Don Giovanni personifies the "aesthehical stage" - self-consuming momentary enjoyment (pleasure principle).
    * Vs. "Ethical stage", subject rises up to the universal moral norm whose proper medium is word (reality principle).

But Don Giovanni's problem arises when he is not content with taking women "one by one", as soon as he endeavors to arrange them into species and sub-species (dispersed collection → structured All; relationship to the signifying structure).
* Different deadlocks when trying to catalogue conquests based on a single principle.
    * Reflection-into-itself of the procedure: the enumeration of the criteria themselves.
* Old woman/ young virgin couple:
    * Conquers old women for the sake of the list
    * The couple (old woman/young woman) holds the place of their genus as such:
        * Next to and other than women who embody different qualities satisfying different needs, exists the Woman, the individual incarnation of the feminine kingdom
            * Lacan's Woman who doesn't exist.
            * This Woman is split into "old" and "young"?
                * Old woman personifies the "exchange-value" of all other women; the symbolic equivalence of all women insofar as they are inscribed in the catalogue
                * Young woman incarnates "use value": the property they must have to satisfy Don Giovanni's passion.
                * Predominance of the exchange-value: "use-value" is mere form of appearance of "exchange-value".
* Don Giovanni associates supreme enjoyment with the list;
    * His potency is a form of appearance of its opposite; impotence as the "impossibility of the sexual relationship".
        * Impossibility due to sexuality's entanglement with language

*Don Giovanni* articulates a refusal of the bourgeois ideology of the love couple prior to its hegemony in the course of the nineteenth century.
* Self-negation: resistance to duty → duty to resist.
    * Kantian "non-pathological", driven by inner compulsion "beyond the pleasure principle".
* *Jacobinism* of the sexual.

### II JUDGEMENT BY DEFAULT

#### "The word is an elephant"

There are* four* types of judgement:
* *Judgement of existence*
    * *Positive judgement:*
        * Derives from the Individual as the last moment of the Notion.
            * Universal - Particular - Individual
        * Judgement divides the Notion into the subject and predicate: determinatedness of an individuality is externalized and posited as such: the individual subject is that predicate (abstract-universal determination).
            * E.g. "The rose is red."
        * All substantial content is on the side of the subject that has "actual existence".
            * The predicate has no self-subsistent existence.
            * External: the predicate is indifferent abstract-universal property acquired by the subject and is not dependent on the subject's inner nature.
    * *Negative judgement *posits the external relationship as such by negating the first form, the substantial nature of the rose is indifferent to whether or not the rose is red:
        * E.g. "The rose is not red."
        * Sustains the  relationship of the subject and predicate; the rose has some other colour.
        * Universal → particular determination: "the subject (this individual) is a particularity."
    * *Infinite judgement:*
        * Bring the negation at work to its self-reference: negates the universal domain itself which was present in the negation of the particular predicate.
            * Negation of negation
        * *Negative form:* Senseless in its form: a particular predicate is negated, whose universal genus itself is incompatible with the subject.
            * E.g. "The rose is not an elephant."
        * Crime: in contrast to legal conflict (particular laws invoked, both sides admit universal law (legality) as the obligatory medium, criminal act calls into question the general sphere of law itself, the law as such.
        * *Positive form: *No particular determination; the opposite is "The rose is a rose".
            * Radical externality to the subject of the predicate: since the subject and predicate are completely external, no predicate can determine the subject, the only adequate predicate is the subject itself.
        * *Affirmative form:*
            * E.g. "the rose is an elephant.", "the spirit is a bone."
            * Expresses speculative lack of identity by means of affirming the impossible identity of two mutually exclusive moments.
                * *"Substance is subject"*: Substance can never encompass in itself the negative power of the Subject and the Subject is none other than this inability, the internal self-split of the Substance.
                * One of the two moments is none other than the non-identity-with-itself of the other moment.
                    * "Spirit is a bone": bone itself can never achieve complete identity with itself and "Spirit" is none other than that "force of negativity" which prevents bone from fully "becoming itself".
            * Lacan: "the word is an elephant."
                * *Speculative identity* of "word" and "elephant": The Notion replaces the thing, which is internalized-sublated in it.
                * The word implies the symbolic murder of the thing; the elephant is more present in the word than in its immediate physical being- it is present in its Notion.
* Dialectics of the judgement of existence leads to absolute contradiction:
    * Subject is reduced to a null "this", cannot attribute any determination to it.
    * Where the transition to the judgement of reflection occurs.
    * All movement is on the side of the predicate.
        * Universal → Particular → Individual
* *Judgement of reflection*
    * The predicate appears as the substantial moment.
    * Some contingent individuality is posited in relation not to its indifferent, abstract-universal property, but* its essential determination*.
        * Universality is encompassing essence which subsumes individualities: ever-wider circle of subjects is subsumed under the predicate as an essential determination which exists in itself.
    * E.g. "Men are mortal", "Things are transient".
        * Transience is essential determination of things, from the negativity outside themselves.
    * Subject is contingent, only to reflect the In-itself of a permanent essence expressed in the predicate.
        * *External reflection*: the finite world is posited as transient, indifferent appearance which reflects some transcendental, universal essence.
    * All movement is on the side of the subject:
        * Individual → Particular → Universal
        * "This man is mortal", "Many men are mortal", "All men are mortal".

#### The paradoxes of sexuation
* *Judgement of necessity*
    * Positing the determination of universality contained in the *universal judgement*.
        * "All men are mortal" → "Man is mortal"
        * Move from the empirical set of "all men" to *universality*, the necessary determination of the notion of man as such.
    * Necessary relationships of Notion; *immanent self-determinations of Notion as such*.
        * "Mortality" is not a predicate of an extra-notional entity but the immanent determination of "man".
    * *Universal vs. Existential judgement* (Aristotle):
        * Existential judgement implies the existence of the subject
        * Universal judgement is true even if its subject does not exist, since it concerns only the notion of the subject.
            * E.g. "unicorn has only one horn."
    * Lacan's formulas of sexuation:
        * Masculine side; the universal function implies the existence of an exception.
            * Universal: "x *as such* is submitted to the phallic function" is constituted through the exception.
            * Empirical (all men) → universality (man) of One-Notion is achieved through subtracting the "unary feature" which totalizes the general (empirical) set.
                * E.g. Some commodity is excluded from the collection of commodities and appears as the general equivalent of all commodities, as the embodiment of Commodity as such.
                * E.g. the Monarch: the set of all men becomes a rational totality (State) only when their unity as such is incarnated in some non-rational, "biologically" defined individual.
                    * All other men have to be "made" (educated), only the monarch is in his nature.
                * "*Negative self-relationship of the Notion*": a universal Notion arrives at its being-for-itself only when it reflects itself in the form of its opposite (in some element which negates the very fundamental feature of its notional universality).
                    * The notion of Man as an active being defining itself through hard work has to reflect itself in an exception, an individual (Monarch) who appears as the embodiment of Man in general insofar as he is already by his nature what he is
        * Feminine side; a particular negation implies that there is no exception.
            * "There is nothing that is not political": 
                * NOT universal judgement (everything is political).
                * The social field is irreducibly marked by a political split, there is no neutral "zero-point" from which society could be conceived as a Whole.
                    * "There is no metalanguage": any kind of description or attempt at conceiving society implies a partial position of enunciation.
    * Does Hegel try to deduce the Particular from the self-movement of the universal Notion?
        * No, he exposes the contingent particularity (exception) to which the Universal itself is linked as with an umbilical cord.

#### How necessity arises out of contingency

Judgement of necessity:
* *Categorical judgement: *the notionally necessary relationship between subject and predicate is posited as the relationship between a species and its genus.
    * E.g. "A rose is a plant", "Woman is human".
    * Leaves aside the fact that the content of the genus is not only this species.
* *Hypothetical judgement: *posits a particular content (species) of the genus in its necessary relationship with another species.
    * E.g. "where there are women, there are also men."
* *Disjunctive judgement:* the particular content of the judgement is posited as self-articulation of the universal Notion.
    * E.g. "A human is either a man or a woman."

**Judgement of the Notion:**
* The content of the predicate is the relationship of the Subject to its Notion.
    * E.g. Truth; it is the adequacy of the object itself to its own Notion.
* *Assertoric judgement:*
    * E.g. "this house is good."
* *Problematic judgement:*
    * Problematizes the conditions of the "truth" of the object.
    * Opposes the inner, necessary Notion of the object and the external contingent conditions on which it is dependent.
* *Apodeictic judgement:*
    * Displays in a positive form the conditions of "truth" of the subject of the judgement.
* The circumstances on which whether or not the subject is adequate to its own Notion are irreducibly contingent, posited as such by the form of the judgement of the Notion.
    * Contingency is the form of appearance of necessity.
        * E.g. The immanent logic of the French Revolution brought about the necessity of a passage from the republican form into that of personal dictatorship; the particular person, Napoleon, as this figure is due to a series of contingencies.
    * A phenomenon ascertains its necessity by positing itself in its contingent presuppositions.
        * Retroactively the conditions of possibility are perceived as necessary.
    * "Substance as subject": as long as contingency is reduced to the form of appearance of an underlying necessity, we are on the level of Substance. When substantial necessity reveals itself to be the retroactive effect of a contingent process, Substance is conceived as Subject.
        * The Subject posits its own substantial presupposition; the contingent conditions of its notional necessity.
* There is no Subject without a gap separating the object from its notion --- gap between the object and its Notion is the ontological condition of the Subject's emergence.
    * Subject is the inadequacy of Substance to itself.
* Lacan's dialectic of desire: always a desire of a desire, aimed at desire "squared".
    * Which desire do I choose?
    * Valuation of desire is based on desire's reflectivity in the symbolic order.

#### "In father more than father himself"

With the judgement of the Notion, we are concerned with the split within the Notion itself, not between the Notion and its empirical actualizations.
* Talking of circumstances on which it depends whether the house is good, in what appears as "external circumstances" in which is actualized the Notion of a house, another Notion is already at work, which is no longer that of a house although it corresponds to the house more than House itself.
    * E.g. a loving stepmother who is more motherly than the mother herself.
* The Notion can never correspond to itself because as soon as it fully realizes itself it passes into another Notion: an X which is fully realized as X is "more X than X itself", and so *no longer X*.
    * Surplus on the side of actualization; notional surplus over the Notion itself.
    * E.g. Hopper's paintings where a man is more present in the traces (half-raised curtain in the window) than in his direct physical presence.
        * Non-X object which is more X than X itself. (window is more human than man itself)
    * E.g. the signifier; the "thing" is more present in the word than its immediate presence.
        * Psychoanalysis: the signifier "father" is more father than the real father.
            * Name-of-the-Father as the "paternal metaphor", sublation of the real father in its Name.
                * Non-sublated part of the father appears as the obscene, cruel and oddly impotent agency of the superego.
                * Father is a symptom as it is the "return of the repressed"	 primordial father.
                    * Primordial father fills out a structural insufficiency of the symbolic function of the Name-of-the-Father, its original status is that of a leftover produced by the failure of sublation which establishes the rule of the Name-of-the-Father. 
            * Name-of-the-Father as metaphoric substitute of the desire of the mother.
![[ziz.png]]

* Judgement of existence - category of impossibility (its "truth" is the infinite judgement where the relationship between subject and predicate is posited as impossible).
    * The impossible real
* Judgement of reflection - possibility of correspondence between subject and predicate.
    * imaginary
* Judgement of necessity asserts necessary relationship between subject and predicate.
    * symbolic
* Judgement of Notion exhibits the ultimate contingency upon which necessity itself depends.
    * The emergence of the symptom is contingent.

## 4 On the Other

### I HYSTERIA, CERTAINTY AND DOUBT

#### ittgenstein as a Hegelian

Wittgenstein: in imagination, we put a thing into its own shape and saw that it fitted; identity-with-itself is paradoxical coincidence of a thing with its own empty place.
* Notion of identity implies the presence of the symbolic order: for an object to "coincide" with its empty place, we must in advance "abstract" it from its place so we can perceive the place without the object.
    * The object's presence perceived *as such* only within a differential order in which absence as such acquires positive value.


#### Hegel's hysterical theatre

Conversion hysteria**: subject gives body to his deadlock, to the kernel that he is unable to put in words, by means of a hysterical symptom --- abnormality of a part of his body or bodily functions.

Hegel's **figures of consciousness**: "existential dramatization" of a theoretical position whereby a certain surplus is produced; the dramatization gives the lie to the theoretical position by bringing out its implicit presuppositions.
* In dramatizing his position, the subject renders manifest what must remain unspoken for this position to maintain its consistency.
* The staging produces "examples" which subvert the very Idea they exemplify: the imperfection of the example with regard to the Idea is an index of the imperfection proper to the Idea itself.
* Hegel's conversion is "mediated" by an impossibility:
    * E.g. the ascetic: since it is impossible to deny the body (which would mean death), the only thing that remains to him is to embody denial itself; while the theoretical position is that bodily life is inherently null and worthless, he is preoccupied with his body all the time, inventing new ways of mortifying and pacifying it instead of assuming an indifferent distance towards it.
* Passage from one figure of consciousness to the next occurs when the subject recognizes the gap between his "enunciated" (theoretical) position from his position of enunciation and assumes what he unknowingly staged as his new explicit theoretical position.
    * Each figure of consciousness stages in advance what will become the next position.

Lacan: man qua being-of-language, constitutively dissatisfied desire (he "doesn't know what he really wants").
* Hysterical conversion, inversion of the impediment:
    * Impeded desire → desire for impediment
    * Unsatisfied desire → desire for unsatisfaction (keeping our desire "open")
    * "We don't know what we desire" → a desire not to know, desire for ignorance
    * Desire remains alive as desire.
    * "Merry butcher's wife": proposes a dream in which the wish is not fulfilled, In which her husband does not satisfy her whim, keeping her desire open and alive;
        * Desire is a desire for desire itself.

Kantian notion of the Sublime: impossibility of presentation → presentation of impossibility.

Hegel's **concrete/determinate negation**: negation of determinate being → determinate being of negation: the determinate being qua negation's outcome is a form in which negation as such assumes positive existence.
* *Spirit *is the power to look the negative in the face and convert it into being; one "tarries with the negative" by conceiving positive being itself as materialization of Negativity, as "metonymy of Nothing".

Wittgenstein; solving seemingly insoluble deadlock by withdrawing from the "thing itself" (problem in its general philosophical form) and concentrating on its exemplifications ("uses" of the notions that define the problem within our everyday "life-form").
* We gain admittance to the domain of Truth only by stepping back.
* The only solution of a philosophical problem is its displacement/reformulation of its terms which makes it disappear as a problem.
* Examples are not "mere examples" but "scenic presentations" which render manifest its unspoken presuppositions.
* Endeavor to translate/transpose "meaning" as fetishistic, a "property of the word", into a series of the ways we use this word.
    * {==The property of an object (the king in chess) is found to be its "determination of reflection"; the reflection-into-the-object of our own, the subject's, dealing with it.==}{>>The properties of the king (his charisma etc.) are translated as a description of how his subjects treat him.<<}

#### Cogito* and the forced choice

Two mutually exclusive interpretations of the Cartesian *cogito* in Lacan:
* *Seminar XI*: cogito as result of forced choice of thought *"to think or to be"*
    * If he chooses being, he loses all (including being itself since he has being only as thinking).
    * If he chooses thought, he is truncated of the part where thought intersects with being (lost "un-thought" inherent to thought itself), *the Unconscious*.
        * Descartes: the subject secures a small piece of being, certainty of "I" as "thinking substance" (*res cogitans*).
        * Lacan: subject left as a remainder of the radical doubt is not a substance ("thing which thinks") but a pure point of substanceless subjectivity; vanishing gap of "*subject of the signifier*", the subject lacking any support in positive, determinate being.
    * *Transference*:  supposed knowledge relying upon being (objet petit a qua remainder-semblance of being lost in the forced choice of meaning).
        * Knowledge that relies on the remainder of being.
    * Lacan in the 1950s:
        * The object is devalorized, the aim of psychoanalytic process is "re-subjectivization"; translation of the "reified" content into the terms of the intersubjective dialectic.
        * Object reduced to a medium.
* *Logic of fantasy*: the subject is condemned to a choice of being: *the Unconscious* is the thought lost by the choice of being.
    * *Cogito ergo sum*: *I (the subject) am in so far as it (Es, the Unconscious) thinks*.
        * Unconscious is the "thing which thinks" and as such inaccessible to the subject: insofar as I am, I am never where "it thinks".
        * I am only insofar as something is left unthought.
            * Lacanian being founded upon misrecognition; the "unconscious" is a knowledge which must remain unknown.
    * The choice of being is the choice of* fantasy* which procures frame and consistency to "reality", whereas the "unconscious" designates scraps of knowledge which subverts this fantasy-frame.
    * Transference: a breakthrough into the domain of knowledge (thought) lost in the forced choice of being.
        * Lost knowledge is transferred to an object (this other subject); we presuppose that this object (subject) possesses knowledge the loss of which is a condition of our very being.
        * Being onto which some impossible/real knowledge is hooked.
    * Lacan in the 1970s:
        * The object within subject comes to the fore; what procures dignity for the subject is agalma, what is "in him more than himself", the object in him.
        * *Intersubjectivity → discourse*; discourse has addition of the object as fourth element to the triad of the two subjects and the big Other as medium of their relationship.
* BOTH: gap separating thought from being; as a subject, I never *am *where I *think*.
    * **Freudian cogito**: doubt → certainty; confirming our certainty by means of the doubt itself.
        * *"Where the subject has doubts, we can be sure that there is unconscious"*: the analysand's hesitation and resistance to accepting an interpretation proposed by the analyst is the best proof that the intervention has stirred up some traumatic unconscious nerve.

#### "Objective certainty"

Wittgenstein: how to I know that I think at all?
* Reference to *"life-form"*
    * NOT a remainder that withstands every doubt
    * The agency that makes every radical scepticism* meaningless* by wearing away its very ground.
        * Forces us to *renounce the very question as false*.
* By the very act of speaking, we partake in the basic social pact, presuppose the consistency of the language order (the big Other).
    * NOT the Cartesian God who does not deceive.
* Our knowing, thinking, speaking, makes sense as moments of a determinate "life-form" within the frame of which individuals relate practically to each other and the surrounding world.
    * "To speak" means to relate to objects in the world.
    * Questions like "How can I be sure that objects in the world actually correspond to the meaning of my words" presuppose a gap which would make the act of speaking impossible were it to exist.

Wittgenstein: **"subjective" vs "objective" certainty**
* Subjective certainty; certainty subjected to doubt, the usual criteria of accuracy and falsity, of knowledge and ignorance apply.
* *Objective certainty*: attitudes and beliefs a priori NOT submitted to test and doubt; calling them into question would undermine the frame of our "life-form", would entail "loss of reality".
    * NOT "we undoubtedly know they are true"; this affirmation introduces reflective distance.
    * Forms the very background against which we may consistently doubt something, test it etc.
    * *Lacanian "big Other"*: the field of a symbolic pact which is "always-already" here, which we "always-already" accept and recognize.
        * *Psychotic* does NOT recognize it, his attitude is that of *disbelief *in the big Other.
* Gap between "*objective certainty*" and "*truth*":
    * Objective certainty is a matter of attitude; there is no assurance that "something unheard of" will not emerge which will undermine "objective certainty".
    * Life-forms ultimately float in empty space/ possess no firm ground.
        * They form self-referring symbolic vicious circles maintaining an unnameable distance from the Real.
    * Wittgenstein breaks out of the Cartesian confines by affirming discontinuity between certitude and "truth".

#### From barred-A to barred-S

Wittgenstein's** "sceptical paradox"**: "no course of action could be determined by a rule because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule."
* Similar to Lacanian structure of joke 
    * e.g. "my fiancée never breaks the rule because when she does she is no longer my fiancée"
        * "I never make a mistake in applying a rule, since what I do defines the very rule."
* *Hermeneutical* refutation: the paradox presupposes a distance towards "rule", whereas in everyday life the rule is inherent to the act itself; constitutes the horizon within which it is possible to speak of the act.
    * Big Other is always-already here; by means of our act of speaking, we attest to our "belief" of it.
    * BUT slips of the tongue cannot be accounted for by the hermeneutical horizon.
        * Our failure to follow the rule, the deviation from it, occurs in accordance with another, unknown rule (the rule unearthed by its interpretation).
        * We have replaced the "big Other" of the hermeneutical horizon with another "big Other", another "rule" guaranteeing consistency of our speech: the analyst functions as the guarantee that all our slips and errancies follow some hidden Rule.

Wittgenstein II → Wittgenstein III: reference to the unquestionable foothold of "life-form" → "nonexistence of the big Other"
* WII leaves out the abyss, "empty" distance which separates a "life-form" from the non-symbolizable Real.
* WIII: three modes of the subject's answer to "*unheard-of-occurence*" (intrusions of some traumatic Real which entails a "loss of reality")
    * 1 - behaving rationally and replacing previous certainty with doubt ("maybe matter *is* just curved space, although my common sense tells me this is absurd")
    * 2 - the shock undermines my capacity to think and to judge ("if nature behaves this way, the universe is mad and nothing consistent can be said about anything")
    * 3 - refuse new evidence and stick to my previous certainty
* Inconsistency of the big Other has its reverse in the splitting of the subject itself: division into S1 and the leftover of the signifying representation, pure void whose counterpart is the non-symbolized object (a).
    * Wittgenstein: "I" does NOT ensure the subject's identity, it is nothing but an empty vanishing point of the "subject of enunciation" which arrives at its identity by means of its identification with a place in the symbolic network.
        * "I, Ludwig Wittgenstein, thereby engage myself..."; The name functions as an answer to the question "Who am I?"
            * These phrases attest to the subject's ability to "*pass to the act*" (assume a symbolic mandate), founded in the certainty of symbolic identification.
            * Hamlet is split between "I" and "Hamlet the Dane"
            * *Passage to the act *is illusory moment of decision when the subject's being seems to coincide with his symbolic mandate without remainder.
            * A* hysteric* is an "I" who resists full identification with the mandate "Ludwig Wittgenstein".

### II THE "FORMAL ASPECT"

#### History of an apparition

Kaspar --- cave child later becoming knight etc.
* His appearance was awaited; he arrived on time as a surprise.
    * Late 18th century science and literature was concerned with the theme of a child living excluded from human community.
* Materially, his emergence resulted from a series of unforeseen and improbable accidents
* Formally, it was necessary: the epoch's structure of Knowledge prepared the place for it in advance
* *Reason vs Understanding:*
    * Understanding: a form expresses some positive, previous content.
    * Reason: empty place preceding the content which fills it out.

#### Saying and meaning-to-say

Usual Reason vs Understanding:
* Reason exhibits the live process of subjective self-mediation whose abstract, "dead" moments are the categories of Understanding.
* *Understanding* sees only rigid determinations
* *Reason *sees the living movement which engenders the determinations.


Hegelian Reason vs Understanding: Reason is the absolute Form beyond which there is no transcendent Content eluding its grasp.
* Understanding → Reason: we subtract the spectre of an Object persisting in its Beyond.


Usual "abstract thought": Understanding thinks abstractly insofar as it subsumes the richness of an object in a particular determination, isolating a single feature from concrete network of determinations.
* E.g. a man is a "thief"
* Dialectical approach is supposed to compensate for the loss of richness by rejoining the wealth of the concrete living totality.
* BUT:
    * Loss is irreparable
        * Lacan: as soon as one speaks, the gap separating the Symbolic from the Real is irreducible.

Hegelian "abstract thought": the progress of dialectical thought in relation to Understanding is not reappropriation but the experience of the nullity of richness:
* Understanding → Reason: the loss of immediacy by Understanding is actually a** loss of a loss**, a loss of something without proper ontological consistency.
* Error of Understanding is the opposition between concrete wealth of the Real (original fullness of Life) and the abstract network of symbolic determinations.
* There is nothing beyond or previous to Understanding; the Beyond of an organic Whole is retroactively posited (presupposed) by Understanding itself.
* Also error of *analytical philosophy* which always has to leave some space for the "real thing"; it does not know that it already has what its looking for elsewhere, its own paradoxes already produce the "subject".
* Reason marks the moment of reduction of all content of thought to the immanence of Understanding.
    * The categories of Understanding "become fluid" when one locates the impetus of their movement in the immanence of their own contradiction.

"Contradiction as the impetus of dialectical movement":
* Contradiction of a Universal with itself (with its particular content): every universal totality contains within its particular elements "at least one" which negates the universal feature that defines the totality.
    * Element which holds the place of the totality's constitutive Outside.
    * What the subject wanted to say vs what he actually said
        * E.g. "principle of identity", the subject who enounces it inscribes difference in the heart of identity ("identity is different from difference")
        * Truth is always on the side of what is said and not on the side of what one "meant to say".
            * Lacan: *significance* (says/saying) vs *signification* (meant to say):
                * The significance of the essence consists in the movement performed by the subject, the procedure where he posits an entity as the appearance of some essence.
        * E.g. Zeno's attempt to prove the nonexistence of Movement and of the Multiple: he "wanted to say" that Movement "doesn't exist" but actually demonstrates the contradictory nature of Movement: Movement exists only as the movement of its own self-sublation, self-surpassing.
            * Zeno: immovable Being "in itself", false appearance of Movement: difference between what is only "for the consciousness" and what exists "in itself" is already there "for the consciousness" (for Zeno himself).
                * Hegel: the place of the difference is not where "naive" consciousness posits it: the truth of Zeno (his "in itself" or "for us) is that the content of immovable Being consists in the Movement of the self-sublation of Movement (the auto-dissolution process of Movement).
                    * For Zeno, this movement is outside of the thing, it is our process towards the One which persists in itself.
                    * "For us", the content of Being IS the path of argumentation which leads towards it.
                    * *"The formal aspect"*: the "truth" of a moment or a stage of the dialectical process is to be sought in its very form--- in the way the consciousness arrived at it.
                        * Content is a "fetish", an object whose inert presence conceals its own form (network of dialectical mediations).
                        * "Kant is not formalist enough": he clings to the postulate of an In-itself supposed to elude the transcendental form and fails to recognize in it a pure "thing-of-thought".

Hegel: truth consists in the correspondence of the object itself to its notion.
* Three elements: the object and its notion which in no way coincides with thought.
    * Notion is form of thought: formal aspect qua truth of content
    * An object can never fully correspond to its notion since its existence, ontological consistency, hangs on non-correspondence.
    * The object itself is the incarnated non-truth; its inert presence fills out a hole in the field of "truth", which is why the passage to the "truth" of an object entails its loss.

#### The Hegelian performative

Commonsensical theory of knowledge: model of penetrating some previously unknown domain, one discovers some reality that already existed prior to our process of knowing it.
* Overlooks how the way knowledge itself modifies its object, confers upon it the form it has as an "object of knowledge".
* Kant: the subject procures universal form for the substantial content of transcendent provenance.
    * *Subject* (transcendental network of the possible forms of experience) *vs substance* (transcendent "Thing-in-itself")
* Hegel: Substance itself as Subject, our act of knowledge is included in advance in its substantial content --- the path towards truth partakes in truth itself.
    * Lacan: proletariat becomes an actual revolutionary subject by way of integrating the knowledge of its historical role--- the knowledge proper to *historical materialism* is self-referential, it changes its "object". The object becomes what it truly "is" only through the act of knowledge.
    * Scission → synthesis;
        * NOT productive act of reconciliation
        * We become aware of how the scission is already in itself reconciliation.
            * Scission is not overcome but rather retroactively undone.
    * Hegel, logic of the signifier: a signifying mark "makes" a thing what it "always-already was".
        * Hegel: necessary deception. Idea sets antithesis to confront, its action is getting rid of the deception which it has created.
            * Error is a necessary dynamic element of truth; truth can only be where it makes itself its own result.
            * Deception I: individual agents pursue their interests whilst unknowingly they are Idea's unconscious tools.
                * Idea realizes its true ends by means of the "cunning of Reason".
                * Implies notion of Reason as substantial entity external to the historical process, at a safe distance.
                    * Substance is not subject: subjects are reduced to the means of a transcendent substantial End.

#### "Cunning of Reason" revisited

Positing the presuppositions:
* Commonplace: (1) immediate → (2) reflective mediation → (3) mediated immediacy
    * BUT (1) is posited retroactively, its emergence coincides with its loss (what is found only comes to be through being left behind): its immediacy is sublated immediacy.
* Deception II: we think that once, before the loss, we possessed what is lost by reflection.
* Loss of the loss: we never had what we have lost, experience that loss precedes what is being lost.
    * Loss is not abolished, its place shifts.
        * Fetishistic disavowal of castration:
            * Disavowal I: of the lack of the phallus, fetishist cannot accept the traumatic fact that woman has no phallus, clings to the fetish-substitute.
            * Disavowal II: of sexual difference:
                * The woman did not "lose" it, in contrast to man, she never had it: perception of "woman has not got it" as "castration" is possible only against the background of "women should be like men".
                * Ultimate disavowal is "castration" itself: experience of the sexual difference as woman's castration.
                * Lacan: the presence of phallus in man should be perceived against the background of its possible absence, in symbolic opposition to it.
                    * Presence of phallus signifies its possible absence, castration.
    * Real socialism: disintegration as "loss", but we never had what we have lost.
        * The traumatic loss is that of "essential appearance" (which nobody believed). The party loses what it never possessed.
* Antagonism as primordial: reconciliation is a humble consent that "all is NOT rational", the moment of contingent antagonism is irreducible, notional Necessity hangs on an encompassing contingency.

Illusory supposition of Reason as transcendent agency is necessary:
* Silent weaving of the Spirit: necessary delay of the formal act of decision. Unconscious weaving does not wait upon us.
* October revolution: they could not have brought about the revolution if they had not believed that they were mere tools of History.
* What we are looking for is created by the very process of our search.
* Lacan: subject supposed to know; absolute knowledge is the fall of the subject supposed to know.

# Cum Grano Praxis

## 5 All's Well That Ends Well?

### I WHY SHOULD A DIALECTICIAN LEARN TO COUNT TO FOUR?
#### The triad and its excesses

The fourth side--- non-dialecticizable excess, inherent condition of possibility of the dialectical movement: negativity of a pure expenditure that cannot be sublated in its Result.
* *Science of Logic*: the subject as the surplus-moment which 'counts for nothing'.
    * Restoration of the first immediacy, of simple universality as self-sublating contradiction.

First moment--- immediate positivity

Second moment--- its mediation, comes forth when we try to grasp the first moment in and for itself, as such. We mediatise it, it turns into its own opposite.
* Not the negative of the first moment, but it is the first moment itself as its own other, as the negative of itself.
* 'Nothingness' is not the external opposite of being; is arrived at by trying to specify, to determine the content of the notion of 'being'.
    * *Inner negativity*: an entity is negated, passes into its opposite, as a result of the development of its own potential.

        * E.g. fascism has its roots in the liberal democracy's own inner antagonisms.

            * *Negativity must be counted twice; *to negate the starting point (liberal capitalism), we must negate its own 'inner negation' in which its content comes to its *truth*.

            * self-relating negation, otherness reflected into itself. Vanishing point of 'pure difference'.
            * Retroactive determination: the first moment itself (Capitalism-in-itself) changes retroactively to its opposite (fascism) when opposed to its radical negative (Capitalism-as-opposed-to-Com
* Adorno, history of music:
    * Determination-by-absence
    * After dissonances, the meaning of the tritone changes, implies the negation of dissonances: new meaning since the absence of dissonances is present in the use of the tritone.

Only three 'positive' moments to count over (immediacy, its mediation, return to the mediated immediacy). But we lose the surplus of the pure difference which counts for nothing although it makes the entire process go.

#### Protestanism, Jacobinism...

Surplus moment qua 'vanishing mediator' in concrete historical content:
* Jameson on Weber's theory of the role of Protestanism in the rise of capitalism:
    * Weber: Protestanism was a condition of capitalism.
    * Jameson: this is compatible with Marxism, dialectical necessity by which the 'normal' relationship of 'base' and 'superstructure' is inversed (feudalism → capitalism).
* Protestanism universalized the relevance of religious ideology.
    * 'Work ethic' conceives the secular activity as the domain of the disclosure of God's grace.
    * Changed place of asceticism:
        * Before: stratum of people separated from everyday secular life, devoted to representing the Beyond.
        * After: every Christian has to act ascetically in his secular life, accumulate his instrumental-economic activity 'with God in mind'.
    * Opens the way to the devaluation of religion, to its confinement to the intimacy of a private sphere.
        * 'Normal' state of the bourgeois society where religion is reduced to 'means' enabling the subject to find new strength and perseverance in the economic fight for survival.
* Protestanism was the 'vanishing mediator' between medieval corporatism and capitalist individualism.
* Jacobinism as 'political Protestanism': it universalizes the democratic political-ideological project; endeavors to make the formal principle structure the totality of social life.
    * Without the Jacobinical 'excess', there would be no 'normal' pluralist democracy.

Illusions of Protestanism and Jacobinism are not impossible ideal, utopias misrecognize the way their ideal state is already realized in its basic content ('in its notion' in Hegelian).

* Capitalist civic society is Protestant content without its positive religious form.
* 'Beautiful soul': they refuse to acknowledge the ultimate consequence of their own act in the corrupted reality over which they lament.

#### ... and other 'vanishing mediators'

Feudalism → Protestanism
* Passage concerning 'content'

Protestanism → bourgeois everyday life
* Passage concerning 'form'

Vanishing mediator emerges because in a dialectical process, form stays behind content.
Negation of the negation:
* First negation consists in invisible change of substantial content which takes place in the name of its own form.
    * Silent weaving of the spirit
* Second negation: the form of negation is negated, 'the change which took place in itself becomes for itself'.

Feudalism → bourgeois political structure; **two vanishing mediators**
* Monarchy: feudalism digs its own grave by giving absolute power to the monarch.
    * Political order 'disconnected' from its economic foundation.
* Jacobinism

Fascism: inherent self-negation of capitalism, subordinating economy to the ideological political domain so that nothing would change.

Leninist 'actually existing socialism': subordinating socioeconomic life to the political regulation of the socialist state.

'Emancipation of form from its content that characterizes the 'vanishing mediator'"
* Protestanism: criticism of the old feudal content in the name of the radicalized version of its own ideological form, allows gradual transformation of the old into the new capitalist content.
* The old 'superstructure' prepares the terrain for the transformation of the 'base'.
* Emancipation emerges when the inner antagonisms of the 'base' become so violent that they can no longer be legitimized by their own ideological form.

Tragically ethical dimension; emancipation of the ideological superstructure presents a unique point at which an ideology 'takes itself literally' and ceases to function as 'objectively cynical' legitimization of the existing power relations.

#### A beat of your finger...

Badiou: 'vanishing mediator' is the moment of the 'event' in relation to the established structure.
* Impossible moment of openness that becomes retroactively invisible.
* Moment of subjectivity.

Hegel: The True is to be grasped 'not only as *Substance* (an objective process governed by hidden rational Necessity) but equally as Subject (process punctuated, scansioned by the moments of openness when the subject's irreducibly contingent act establishes new Necessity).
* Proper Hegelian move disperses the fetish of 'objective historical process' and enables us to see its genesis, how historical Necessity sprang up as a 'coagulation' of radically contingent decision of the subject in an open situation.
* Dialectical necessity is a necessity apres coup: proper dialectical account confronts the self-evidence of "what actually took place" with what did NOT take place.
* Since our reality is the result of contingent acts, the only way to define our actual world properly is to include in its definition the negation of the "possible worlds" contained in its position --- our lost opportunities are part of what we are, they qualify it.


'Positing the presuppositions': the way Necessity arises out of contingency: it is the moment** the subject vanishes as a mediator**, when the subject's contingent act changes into its opposite, establishes a new symbolic network by means of which History acquires the self-evidence of a linear evolution.
* Act is successful by becoming invisible, by positivizing itself in a new symbolic network wherein it locates and reduces itself to a mere moment of the totality engendered by its own act.
    * E.g. Stalinist position of pure metalanguage: Marxists did not speak from the subjective position of the proletariat, they 'based their orientation on' the proletariat from an external, neutral, 'objective' position.
* Lacanian act: a move that defines its own conditions, retroactively produces grounds which justify it.
    * Act is retroactively performative.
* Hegelian dialectics of law and its transgression:
    * From perspective of existing, positive laws, an act is Crime since it violates its symbolic limits and introduces an unheard-of element which turns everything topsy-turvy.
    * Dialectical genesis renders visible the 'scandalous' origins of the existing law.
* Act is the emergence of a new master signifier.

#### Why is truth always political?

Lefort and Laclau: difference between 'the Political' and 'politics':
* Politics qua separate social complex, positively determined subsystem of social relations in interaction with other subsystems.
* The Political qua the moment of openness when the structuring principle of society is called in question.

The genesis of society is always 'political'; a positively existing social system is nothing but a form in which the negativity of a radically contingent decision assumes positive, determinate existence.

'Politics' as a subsystem, as a separate sphere of society, represents within society its own forgotten foundation, its genesis in a violent, abyssal Act.
* Lacanian signifier --- politics qua subsystem represents the Political (subject) for all other social subsystems.


Negativity is not just exception between two normalcies: the stable network of 'subsystems' is the form of hegemony of one pole in the social antagonism.
* Once it becomes one amongst the others (only a subsystem), the element loses its character of One which holds the place of Nothing (of radical negativity).


Greimasian 'semiotic square':
![[grem.png]]
* Upper opposition dissolves into 'possibility' (as negation of negation of necessity)
* The Contingent disappears, is not equal to the Possible.
    * Encounter with the Real
    * The Possible is pacified contingency.
    * Psychoanalysis: truth belongs to the order of contingency
        * Radically anti-Platonic: the Universal is the domain of Falsity par excellence, truth emerges as a particular contingent encounter which renders visible its 'repressed'.
        * Truth as possibility loses its character of an 'event', becomes part of the ruling universal Lie.

De-ontological square:
![[grem2.png]]
* Fourth term has no name, 'you may...' that is not yet 'you can...'
    * Permissiveness is warranted by the universal Order, this guarantee lacks in 'you may...'
    * Lacan: *scilicet*: you may know the truth about your desire if you take the risk upon yourself.

### II THE "MISSING LINK" OF IDEOLOGY

#### The self-referring structure and its void

Fantasy - time loop: the subject is present as a pure gaze at the act of its own conception.
* The object of fantasy is the impossible gaze witnessing it.
* The subject *topic, content of the fantasy
    * E.g. Blue Velvet, the hero sees Hopper and Rossellini through fissure in the closet.
        * Hero is object
        * Content of the fantasy is the subject *topic.
* The subject qua pure gaze precedes itself and witnesses its own origin.

Why does the subject supplant its lack of being ("want to be") by means of an impossible gaze?
* Symbolic order is synchronous, causal chain is diachronous
* *Subject is the missing link *in the causal chain, holds the place of the synchronous set's foreclosed diachronous genesis.
* Gap, incompatibility between cause and effect is constitutive of the effect, we lose effect when we re-establish the complete chain, we lose their effect.
    * Missing link is ontological, "substance is subject"
* Intersubjectivity is founded upon the fact that the other is phenomenologically experienced as an unknown quantity.
    * The big Other designates the radical alterity of the other person beyond our mirroring in it, beyond our recognition of it as our mirror-image.
    * Agnostic foundation of language qua the order of symbolic engagement; the word engages because there is no guarantee that it will be kept.
        * Background of absolute unknowableness.
        * The Other qua another person is ontologically unknowable; its unknowableness is the way its very being is ontologically constituted, disclosed to us.
            * Kantian unknowable "Thing-in-itself" is ultimately man himself.
* *Subject qua missing link is the subject of the signifier*; the signifying structure is the articulation of its void (representation of the subject).

Language emerges by definition *ex nihilo* (impossibility of assuming external position from which we could "compare" words and things).
* Autonomy of the signifier is correlative to the "subjectivization" of the signifying chain; subjects are the abyss that forever separates language from the substantial life-process.
* Davidson: disjunction between the theory of truth (semantic) and the epistemological problematic of ascertaining how we proclaim a proposition or theory to be "true".
    * Theory of truth (the theory telling us what is truth) is the theory procuring formal, transcendental, a priori guarantees for the truth of our knowledge.
* The barrier separating the Symbolic from the Real is impossible to trespass since the Symbolic IS this very barrier; the way language relates to "supra-linguistic reality" is already overdetermined by language itself.

Symbolic order, **retroactive causality**:
* "Substantial" causality runs in a linear-progressive way, time runs backwards in the symbolic order.
* Symbolic efficiency (Levi-Strauss) consists in continuous "rewriting of its past".
* *Wolf man, deferred action in neurotic causality*: what was originally a meaningless event retroactively acquires meaningful impact, the traces of the event are included in a symbolic network only later, retroactively.
    * Psychoanalysis is concerned with the way past events are included in *the present, synchronous field of meaning.*
* Traumatic encounters do determine the present, but the very mode of this determining is overdetermined by the present synchronous symbolic network.
    * The trace of an old encounter suddenly begins to exert impact because the present symbolic universe of the subject is structured in a way that is susceptible to it.
* Incessant rewriting of the past is to restore the "missing link" by reconstituting its origins backwards because the chain of linear causality is always broken.

#### Narrating the origins

The fantasy-object as gaze fills out a void constitutive of the symbolic order; obscures the fact that any field of symbolically structured meaning always presupposes and precedes itself.
* It is by definition impossible to adopt an external attitude towards a field of meaning once we are within it.
* Vicious circle, tautologies: "Law is law" implies the illegal and illegitimate character of the foundation of the reign of law.
    * Concealment of the violent act of foundation of law is the positive condition of the functioning of law.
        * Kant forbids probing into the obscure origins of legal power, forbids something which is already in itself posited as impossible.
            * Reversal of his ethical dictum "you can because you must!" → you cannot arrive at the obscure origins of the law, because you must not do it!
* "Social contract" fantasy presupposes in advance what is its result; the presence of individuals who act according to the rules of a civilized rational order.
    * The pathological act of violence out of which the civil constitution grew is necessarily foreclosed in this fantasy, it is the "forbidden" mediator which must vanish, turn into a "missing link"
        * Primordial repression of the paradox of a violent act by means of which "nature" surpasses itself (already perverted nature) and grounds "culture" (not culture since it is an excess of violence that is foreclosed by culture).
            * Intersection of culture and nature, *domain of the abyss of absolute freedom*.
    * What the reign of law has to tame and subdue is NOT "nature" but the excess of Evil by means of which nature surpasses itself into culture.
        * Man's "unruliness" (Kant: owing to his natural love of freedom), self-destructive freedom is *death-drive*.
    * *Nature → culture* is the inner split of nature into nature as balanced circuit regulated by instincts and nature as "unruliness" that has to be tamed by law.
        * Death drive is the vanishing mediator, point at which nature itself uncannily resembles culture in its highest form ("non-pathological" moral act).

Kant, difference between regicide and the execution of the king's death sentence.
* Form and content: 
    * regicide violates legal norms but does not affect the form of legality; the relation of an excess to the norm
    * Execution of death sentence subverts the form of legality and sovereignty, death of the royal function itself
        * Crime assumes the form of law, undermines it from within.
    * Impossible crime is close to the ethical act; has the form of legality, it is not guided by material, "pathological" motives.
        * Sade, "absolute crime" which interrupts the circuit of nature.
        * From the standpoint of Nature, "Spirit" is "a crime which can never be effaced".
            * Every positive law is already its own mocking imitation. Previous "unwritten law" has its status as the Real--- it is retroactively presupposition as that which was violated by means of the imposition of our "human" reign of law.

#### So-called "primitive accumulation"

Marx: "the anatomy of man offers us a key to the anatomy of monkey"
* We do NOT derive man from monkey, we retroactively reconstruct the diachronous genesis of "man" from "monkey" (from the standpoint of the finished result)
* "Primacy of synchrony over diachrony" in genesis of capitalism:
    * "Historical" method of explanation: to understand a given phenomenon theoretically equates to deploying its historical genesis.
    * Marx does the OPPOSITE:
        * First, presents the "synchronous" cut of the universe of capital
        * Then, confronts the question of its historical genesis in the form of "so-called primitive accumulation".
    * Once capitalism establishes as a fully articulated system, it is indifferent towards the conditions of its emergence:
        * Two conditions;
            * A workforce freed from its "substantial" attachment to the objective conditions of production (means and objects of production)
                * Reduced to the status of pure subjectivity
            * Money (capital)
        * The origins of the conditions we do not have to be acquainted with in order to grasp the "synchronous" functioning of the capitalist system.

"So-called" primitive accumulation" is nothing but the ideological myth produced by capitalism to explain its own genesis and justify present exploitation.
* "Explains" the emergence of capitalism by presupposing the existence of an agent who "acts like a capitalist" from the very beginning.
* *Logic of fantasy*; the "capitalist" is present as a gaze at its own conception.
    * The fantasy-construct assures the presence of the subject in the character of pure gaze at its own conception by enabling it to "jump into the past" and appear as its own cause.
    * Fantasy is narration: it has the structure of a story to be narrated.
        * *Logos* vs *mythos*, how to present the Absolute:
            * Hegel: the totality of the Absolute can be conceived and presented in the form of the Notion's logical development.
                * History is reduced to the "external", temporal appearance of the inner, timeless logical articulation.
            * Schelling: God cannot be reduced to logos, there is something in Him which is not Reason, Word, the obscure foundation of His existence, what is in God "more than Himself". 
                * The presentation of the content of the Absolute must assume the form of a narration, beyond rendering th inner necessity of a network of pure logical determinations.
            * Marx: Gap between historical description and dialectical presentation is irreducible
                * Historical description renders manifest the radically external historical presuppositions of the synchronous dialectical totality, its contingent starting point that eludes dialectical grasp, its missing link whose exclusion the dialectical totality endeavors to fill out by means of a fantasy-scene.

Hegel; dialectical "speculation"--- the circle remains for ever a vicious one (**Moebius band**)--- accounts for contingent materiality that cannot be "sublated".
* Dialectical presentation renders the process of inversion (contingent): external/contingent presuppositions are retroactively "posited" within a synchronous circle.
* Dialectical presentation unmasks the fetish of an Origin.
    * National myths; the fight for national revival is a defence of something which comes to be only through being experienced as lost or endangered.
* Dialectical analysis is a repeating "going through the fantasy" which keeps the vicious character of the circle unconcealed.

#### The paradox of a finite totality

Systems theory--- "auto-poetic" systems, systems which transform their initial conditions by means of retroactive "trans-coding".
* Hegelian "self-relating of the Notion": the initial category "develops" into a "higher" category as it is "trans-coded", posited as its subordinate-mediated moment.
    * Being → essence: domain of "being" is retroactively determined as that of the "appearance", as the medium in which "essence" becomes manifest, appear to itself.
* The new emerging category is nothing but the principle of trans-coding the preceding categories
    * "Essence" is "appearance qua appearance"--- nothing but the principle of trans-coding immediate being into a "mere appearance"

External presuppositions- real of violence founding the system and disavowed once the system reaches the level of its self-reproduction- are **vanishing mediators**.
* External conditions of the structure's genesis are constituted by means of their "repression", trans-coding effaces their external, contingent character.
* Psychoanalysis: trans-coding concerns the integration of some external, contingent traumatic kernel into the subject's symbolic universe ("gentrify" a traumatic experience), effacing its traumatic impact by transforming it into a moment of meaningful totality.
* Jacobins are proclaimed accidental exception to the liberal mainstream (human rights and freedoms etc.)

Why is the repression of the vanishing mediator necessary?
* A symbolic system has the character of *totality*: there is meaning only if everything has meaning.

Lacan: **primordially repressed signifier**, **missing link** of the signifier's chain is the **binary signifier**; its constitutive lack causes the chain to run in a circle producing again and again new **"unary" signifiers (Master-Signifiers**) which endeavor to close the circle by retroactively providing it with foundation.

The symbolic order is defined by the paradox of a finite totality; everything can be said in language, yet this very totality is simultaneously marked by an irreducible finitude.
* Loop in language; we presuppose that language depends on external reality, yet this external reality is always already disclosed through language, mediated by it.
* Intermediary status of the symbolic; Kantian transcendental constitution is ontologically constitutive of what we call "reality".
    * Transcendental constitution is NOT ontic causation ("creation") of reality, it is its ontological horizon.
* Hegel's absolute knowledge; because we are absorbed into history without remainder, we perceive our present standpoint as "absolute"--- we cannot maintain external distance towards it.
    * Absolute knowledge is the explication of the historically specified field that limits our horizon.
    * Hegel maintains the gap around which the transcendental field is structured. The gap is displaced; the external limit preventing the closure of the circle changes into a curvature which makes the closed circle vicious.

#### The Kantian Thing

"Thing-in-itself" is **ontic**: innerworldly entities which must fail to appear, fall out from the ontological horizon if the ontological constitution is to take place.

Kant: God qua thing is impossible and forbidden.

"I" is the empty form of thought, we cannot accomplish the step from it towards substance and attain the hypothetical X "thing that thinks".

Subject is the gap separating two perspectives (determinism/immediately free subject); subject is the gap within subject, discontinuity which prevents us from conceiving the substance as a self-contained totality.
* Subject entails reversal of the notion of historical process as "forwards open--- backwards determined".
    * Freud: deferred action is
        * NOT gentrification of traumatic encounter
        * Something which was at first perceived as a meaningless, neutral event changes retroactively, after the advent of a new symbolic network that determines the subject's place of enunciation, into a trauma that cannot be integrated into the network.
        * Act of freedom:
            * When we are caught in the flow of events, we act "automatically", as if under the impression that it is not possible to do otherwise, that there is no choice; the retroactive view displays how the events could have taken a radically different turn.
            * Act is never present, the subjects are never fully aware that what they are doing "now" is the foundation of a new symbolic order.
            * The time of the subject is never "present"; the subject never "is", it only "will have been": we never ARE free, it is only afterwards that we discover how we HAVE BEEN free.
                * Missing link is never missing "now"--- in the present time, the chain is always completed, we discover how "something is missing" only afterwards when we endeavour to reconstruct the chain.

## 6 Much Ado about a Thing

### I THE VARIANTS OF THE FETISHISM-TYPE

#### Why is Sade the truth of Kant?

Lacan: Kant was the first to outline the dimension of "beyond the pleasure principle"
* Impetus of our practical activity is representation of object and the pleasure/displeasure attached to its representation sets off our activity.
    * Empirical, 'pathological'
* Supreme Good is inaccessible, irrepresentable.
    * Barred G
* A priori impetus of will found in the* form* of the activity, not content: form of universal legislation, independent of contingent particular content.
    * Moral Ought [*Sollen*]
* Supreme Good, Law is Vorstellungsreprasentanz: representative of "primordially repressed" representation. The* form* of Law emerges in the place of missing representation, filling its void.
    * Form supplanting, holding the place of the missing content.* Moebius band*: form is NOT reverse of content, we encounter it when we progress far enough on the side of content itself.
* *Symbolic castration*: "wiping out" of pathological content (Mother as Supreme Good), which is formally substituted with paternal Law.
    * Prohibition of incest:
        * Utilitarianism, Levi-Strauss etc. Refer to some Good as the ground of prohibition.
        * Lacan: *prohibition of incest* is unconditional since it is radically unaccountable.
            * "I give something (sex with relative) in exchange for nothing" → "I give nothing (the incestuous object is in itself impossible) in exchange for something (the "permitted" non-incestuous object)"
            * Freud: "economic problem of masochism" only accounted by "pure" loss which opens up the field, all object are present against the background of a radical absence opened up by the "wiping out".
                * *Logic of signifier*; primacy of the place over the element, the empty place ensure that every positive element occupies a place which is not "consubstantial" to it.
* Reduction to the pure form produces of itself a new object; "non-pathological" object, *objet petit a*, the surplus-enjoyment, the object-cause of desire.
    * Inversion in Moebius band on the level of form itself: if we progress far enough on the surface of the pure form, we come across a non-formal "stain" of enjoyment which smears the form": renunciation of "pathological" enjoyment brings about surplus-enjoyment.
    * In Kant, the objet petit a is superegoic injunctions, subject's secret enjoyment of failure.
        * Kant conceals the split of the subject into the subject of the enunciated and the subject of the enunciation, implicated in moral law.
            * Kant's depository example, cannot take deposit because if followed through, there would be no depositing left.
                * "No deposit without a depositary equal to his charge".
                * The "subject of the enunciation" is silently reduced to the "subject of the enunciated"--- Kant presupposes a depositary "equal to his charge"
            * Lacan: there is in the subject who agrees to incarnate an S1 an excess, a side which does not let itself be taken into the S1.
                * Excess is the side of the object within the subject

#### The "totalitarian object"

Split between the subject of the enunciated and the subject of the enunciation at work in the domain of Law:
* S1, Law in neutral, solemn side
* Behind it, the side of the object which announces obscene mischievousness.
* "There are no longer cannibals in our region, we ate the last one yesterday".
    * Subject of the enunciated, there are no more cannibals
    * Subject of the enunciation is the "we"
        * The order of the Law prohibiting cannibalism can be ensured only by means of an obscene agent who takes upon himself to eat the last cannibal.

This is Sade's executioner, the agent who practices his "sadistic" activity on the victim.
* Has no pleasure, *stricto sensu* ethical, works for the enjoyment of the Other; sole instrument of the Other's Will.
* The Party in "totalitarianism", agent-instrument of historical Will.
    * Stalin: we are made of special mould--- incarnation of the *objet petit a*.
* Lacan: perversion is "inverted effect of the fantasy. The subject determines himself as object in his encounter with the division of subjectivity."
    * a * $; by occupying the place of the object, avoids the division constitutive of the subject and transposes his division upon his other.
    * The Other of Stalinism (inevitable necessity of laws of historical development) is new version of Sade's "Supreme Being of Evilness".
* Stalinist avoids constitutive division but pays for it through the total alienation of his enjoyment.
* Classical Master (S1), totalitarian Leader (a)
    * S1 is auto-referential signifier which embodies the performative function of the word.
    * Enlightenment doesn't want this instance of "irrational" authority, Master reappears as "totalitarian" Leader
    * Totalitarian Leader takes the shape of an object which embodies S2 ("objective knowledge of the laws of history") and assumes responsibility of carrying out the historical necessity in its cannibalistic cruelty.
    * Matheme of "totalitarian" subject:
![[sas.png]]

* Semblance of "objective" knowledge under which the obscene object-agent of a superegotistical Will hides.
    * Totalitarianism makes resort to a bureaucratic "knowledge" (S2) which lacks support in a S1 that would "quilt" its field.
            * Totalitarian Leader is obeyed because he is effective, charismatic etc.
        * Vs Classical Master based on the gap of S1 in relation to S2.
            * The king is obeyed because he is the king.
* When does state bureaucracy become "totalitarian"?
    * When the bureaucratic knowledge loses its support in the S1 and is "left to itself", assumes the features of "mischievous neutrality" proper to superego.
        * The status of superego is that of a chain of knowledge (S2) and not that of a unary point of symbolic authority (S1).
            * Discourse of Stalinist bureaucracy; its position of enunciation is objective, neutral knowledge. This position is in itself enjoying the subject's failure to live up to its impossible demands, is superegotistical.
                * What we accept as reality is always sustained by a superego imperative (Stalinist confessions, only alternative to avoid the "loss of reality").

Lacan: superego is an injunction to enjoyment: "Enjoy!"
* Law vs Superego:
    * Law: agency of prohibition which regulates the distribution of enjoyment on the basis of common renunciation (symbolic castration)
    * Superego: point at which permitted enjoyment, freedom-to-enjoy-, is reversed into obligation to enjoy (which effectively blocks access to enjoyment).
* Kafka's obscene judges of Law: the superego is a solemn indifference impregnated in parts by obscenities.
* Superego is the purest embodiment of the signifier as the cause of the subject's division, signifier's injunction in its traumatic aspect.

Lacan against the customary opposition of external social law and the unwritten ethical "inner law" in whose name we can resist the external legal regulations: the subject's desire itself functions "beyond the pleasure principle"; 
* Kant's ignorance of the fact that a certain "idealism" (disregard for the "pathological" consideration) is already at work in the domain of desire, of sexual "passion".
* Desire is ethical in the strictest Kantian sense.
* Pleasure vs enjoyment: only an act of transgression procures enjoyment, enjoyment is the surplus from knowledge that our pleasure involves a certain displeasure.
* The simple opposition broken by the short circuit between desire and law: a point at which desire becomes Law, insistence upon one's desire equates to fulfilling one's duty, Duty itself is marked by a stain of surplus-enjoyment.
    * Paradox of Kafkaesque bureaucratic machinery epitomizes the perverse reverse of the "inner" law itself.
* The subject discovers in himself after renouncing his "pathological" interest for the sake of autonomous moral law an unconditional injunction to enjoyment.
    * What works against the social Good is not egotistical pleasure-seeking but the superegotistical reverse of the moral law: obscene call to enjoyment.
        * Freud: "primary masochism".
    * Totalitarianism is NOT the retreat of inner "unwritten law" under the pressure of the external social law (individual forfeits moral autonomy follows group)
        * It is short circuit entailing the loss of the distance between the two.
        * Pacifying intervention of the external social law enables us to elude the self-torture provoked by the obscene superegotistical "law of conscience".
        * *Carpe diem* is the condensed formula of "totalitarianism".

#### "I know, but nevertheless..."

Predominance of superego disturbs the relationship of knowledge and belief, produces gap between (real) knowledge and (symbolic) belief:
* "Pragmatic paradoxes": "I know it is so, but nevertheless I can't believe it"
    * Traumatic knowledge of reality remains outside the Symbolic, "time for understanding" is needed for it to be integrated into our symbolic universe.
    * Contradiction only on the pragmatic level (taking into account the position of the subject of the enunciation).
        * Split subject
        * Solution is repressing the belief in our unconscious ("rationalization)
* Lying by way of the truth: "I know that the Jews are guilty of nothing, nonetheless, the fact is that Jews benefit from capitalism financial and business."
    * Second part functions as a lie, in the concrete symbolic context operates as a ratification of the unconscious belief that Jews are nevertheless guilty.
    * E.g. Stalinist "dialectical materialism", "analysis of concrete circumstances"
* De Sade: the existence of God is affirmed on the level of knowledge, not on the level of belief.
    * Represses knowledge: "I know that God exists, but nevertheless I act as though I believe that there is no God".
* Totalitarian ideology relies on different self-distance than "inner distance" towards the "external" ritual through which ideologies reproduce themselves.
    * Orwell:
        * There is no big Other that is not manipulated; the one who most believes in "totalitarianism", in the results of manipulation, is the manipulator himself.
        * Doublethink: consciously manipulating the whole time, fabricating "objective reality", at the same time sincerely believing in the results of this manipulation.
    * Totalitarian universe is a universe of psychotic split, disavowal of the obvious evidence, the knowledge that we deceive does not prevent us from believing in the result-effect of the deception.
        * Seeing the moment of truth only in the manipulation (Nazis as cynical authority) enables us to reduce the Nazi subject to the traditional utilitarian-egotistical bourgeois subject.

#### Traditional, manipulative, totalitarian power

Three modes of working with the logic "I know, but nevertheless..." (disavowal of castration):
* *"Normal"*
    * Hopi children naively believe that they are faced with a terrible apparition (masks) until they are initiated and parents reveal the people behind the mask.
    * Deception → mystical truth: rejecting reality (the gods are fathers and uncles) with transformation of belief.
        * *Imaginary → symbolic*: belief abandons imaginary form and is symbolized to open faith or commitment.
        * Entry into the symbolic changes the relationship between the mask and the people behind; now the real secret is the "efficacy" of the mask as such.
            * Spirit dwells in the mask itself: the symbolic function has more weight than its bearer, than that which is hidden behind the ritual form.
    * *Internalization*: no longer believe in direct reality of the mask, the mask is only a signifier which expresses internal, invisible spirit.
* *"Manipulative"*
    * Casanova as magician impostor who exploits the superstition of fools.
    * Manipulator knows very well that the magic ritual is only deception, if the manipulation is too successful (thunderstorm outside), it seems as though the real "answered" the manipulation, the distance between manipulator and manipulated is destroyed and the manipulator himself falls into credulity, begins to believe in his own deception.
    * *Passage to symbolic belief is not possible*, when the manipulator loses the external distance, he falls into the same naive-imaginary belief.
* *"Fetishistic"*
    * Not concerned with belief, the second moment "but nonetheless" is directly incarnated in the fetishistic object.
    * "Ordinary people" are not simpletons but simply ignorant; *the fetishist has privileged access to the Object.*
    * Opposite of Casanova, he appears to "ordinary people" as a simpleton, convinced of the exceptional value of the chosen Object.

Three elementary structures of the exercise of authority:
* *Traditional authority*: mystique of the Institution.
    * Authority based on symbolic ritual, form of the Institution as such.
    * Judge experiences mystic transubstantiation; no longer speaks as a person, it is Law itself which speaks through him.
        * The form of the Law itself must remain inviolate to Socrates, he did not run from it even though the empirical content was faulty.
    * Constitutional Authority is better, however faulty in its content, than authority which is fortuitously "fair", yet without support in an Institution.
    * *Phallic power: Woman as one of the Names-of-the-Father:* Father's authority is to be fully trusted, yet one should not put it to the test too often, one is bound to discover that Father is an impostor and his authority is a pure semblance.
        * It is actual (effective) only as potential; its full deployment lays bare its imposture.
        * Economy: we possess power, we are "in" it, only insofar as we do not put it to use thoroughly, insofar as we economize.
        * Lacanian plus-One, necessary surplus empty element whose value is accepted on trust.
* *Manipulative authority*:
    * Authority based on the direct manipulation of its subjects.
    * Late-bourgeois society of "pathological Narcissism"; individuals who wear social masks not taking them seriously, the aim of the social game is to deceive the other.
    * *Cynicism*: the cynic concludes that the Other does not function, is not effectual, based on the fact that "the Other does not exist" (symbolic order is only a fiction, does not pertain to the Real).
        * The cynic only believes in the Real of enjoyment, preserves external distance towards the symbolic function, uses it as a means of manipulation.
* *Totalitarian authority*:
    * Although the fetishist knows very well that they are people like others, at the same time consider themselves to be "people of a special mould, made of special stuff".
    * "The emperor has no clothes"
        * Manipulative: phrases about values, honor, honesty are all empty words, what counts is only the Real (money, power, influence).
            * Cynical demystification fails to notice how the "naked Real" is sustained by the symbolic fiction.
        * Totalitarian: just because the Emperor is naked we must hold together the more, our Cause is all the more necessary.
    * Totalitarian authority needs "Goldstein's book"; it settles accounts with the big Other, the guarantor of truth, the book expresses the truth for the Party.

### II "THE KING IS A THING"

#### The King's two bodies

Saint-Just: Revolution has established happiness as a political factor.
* *NOT enjoyment, but revolutionary Virtue*: radical renunciation of the decadent pleasures of the* ancien régime*.
* In the Jacobinical universe, the king is the embodiment of the surplus enjoyment corrupting the sound body of the People.
    * Anamorphotic *reversal*: the King used to be the charismatic embodiment of the People, immediate existence of the People's "life-substance". Now it is a cancerous protuberance contaminating the body of the People.
    * Marx: the proper way to get rid of the illusion that "to be a king" is an immediate natural property of the person of a king is to dissolve the network of social relations within which a certain person acquires the status of a king.
        * Distinction between king as a symbolic function and its empirical bearer.
        * BUT, *"chiasmic exchange of properties"*: the king's ordinary properties undergo "transubstantiation" as soon as he functions as "king", his ordinary properties become an *object of fascination*
            * The more we accentuate the king's "pathological" features, the more he remains "king".
            * The symbolic function redoubles his body, introduces a split between the material body and another, sublime body made of a special immaterial stuff.
                * The second body is *objet petit a*, a sublime evasive body which is a "thing of nothing", *pure semblance without substance.*
                * Hamlet doesn't strike the king because he knows that he must strike something other than what is (materially) there.
* Jacobins' regicide is impotent acting out which was simultaneously excessive and empty.
    * The decapitation was superfluous AND a sacrilege confirming the king's charisma by means of his physical destruction.

#### Lenin's two bodies

Jacobin's did not want to pass a threshold beyond which they could again rule innocently by means of assuming the position of a pure instrument of the Other's will.
* They lacked the absolute certainty that they were nothing but an instrument fulfilling the Will of the big Other, they were tormented by the possibility of pathological private interest behind the façade of the executor of the Terror on behalf of revolution.
* Ontologically guilty, could not free themselves of from their own will.
* Their Terror was democratic and not "totalitarian" (where the revolutionaries fully assume the role of an instrument of the big Other).

The "totalitarian" Party is an immediate individual incarnation of objective laws, point of paradoxical short circuit between subjective will and objective laws.

#### How to extract the People from within the people?

The sublime body is the "little piece of the real" which holds the place of law's founding/foreclosed violence within the space of law, and thus conceals the void of the law's vicious circle.

The Leader's sublime body VS traditional "king's two bodies":
* Act of *emptying*:
    * Kant: emptying the locus of the Supreme Good: every positive object is by definition "pathological", the moral law must be reduced to the pure Form bestowing on our acts the character of universality.
    * Jacobins: evacuation of the locus of Power: "nobody can rule innocently".
* Sadeian vision of Nature:
    * Similar to Stalinist "dialectical materialism": Nature conceived as an eternal circuit of generation and corruption.
    * The only way to enable Nature to create something new is an absolute Crime which interrupts this circuit and liberates Nature from its own laws.
    * *Sublimation and death-drive*: sublimation equates to creation ex nihilo, on the basis of annihilation of the preceding Tradition.
        * Extraction of the People from within the people equates to the extraction of the sublime, pure object (Thing) from the corrupted Body.
* Time paradox: the People charges the Convention (its delegates) with the mandate to give birth to the People.
    * Paradoxical presence of* a pure object, voice or gaze: *the Nation is present as* a superego voice *before its proper birth.
    * The Leader's sublime body: by conceiving of himself as an agency through which the People gives birth to itself, the Leader assumes the role of *a deputy from the future*.

#### The "Hypothesis of the Master"

Functioning of a given ideological field is grasped through:
(1) reference to the symbolic order and its different mechanisms.
(2) remainder of an object which resists symbolization, materializes pure enjoyment, assumes the form of the King's or Leader's** other, sublime body.**
* This remainder allures the subject to "give way as to his desire" and entangle himself in the paradoxes of voluntary servitude.
    * It is the subject himself who makes the Master a Master by behaving towards him in a subject-like way.
    * La Boétie: stop treating the Master like a Master and he will cease to be one automatically.
        * The subject is NOT obliged to make an effort to deliver himself (content?), just an effort to want to do so (formal gesture?)
            * No gap between "will" and its accomplishment.

**Freedom**: impossible point of pure "performativity" where intention coincides immediately with its fulfilment; to have it, I just have to desire it.
* Saturation completely blocks the space of desire: "hypothesis of the Master" enables us to save our desire from this saturation: we externalize the inherent impasse of desire, transforming it into a "repressive" force which opposes it from outside.
    * E.g. the Despot who does not provide the object-cause of our desire because of his purely arbitrary whim.
        * Mother ("primordial Other") appears as the "phantom of Omnipotence" before the reign of Law: the subject depends on its "whim" for the satisfaction of its needs.
            * Subject's desire is reduced to the demand for the Other's love.
        * The advent of Law entails "disalienation": the subject is no more at the mercy of the Other's whim, its desire is no more totally alienated in the Other's desire.
            * Distance established towards the Mother's desire.
            * Law as agency of "disalienation" and "liberation": it opens our access to desire by enabling us to disengage ourselves from the rule of the Other's whim.
            * Negation of negation; self-relating negation:
                * The subject liberates itself by experiencing the negative power of the Other's self-referential character.
* The "Other's whim" fantasy-image is a way to avoid the lack in the Other.
    * Lacan:* Father itself (as agency of prohibition) is a symptom*, a "compromise-formation" which attests to the fact that the subject "gave way as to its desire".
        * Desire in its purity is death-drive: the ultimate annihilation of its symbolic identity, when the subject endures confrontation with the Real.
        * "Normal" resolution of the Oedipus complex as symbolic identification with the paternal metaphor is a way for the subject to avoid the impasse constitutive of desire by
            * *Impossibility → prohibition*.
            * The aim of psychoanalysis is to induce the analysand to choose "the worst" in the alternative "the Father or the worst" *(le pere ou le pire)*; choosing the desire's impasse by fully assuming the impossibility constitutive of desire.

#### The King as a place-holder of the void

Hegel's deduction of monarchy from his *Philosophy of Right: *the reverse of the "symptom"; the King's body could function as the guarantee of the non-closure of the Social the acceptance of which characterizes democracy.
* Lefort: the locus of Power becomes an empty place with the advent of the "democratic invention".
    * Democratic invention constitutes the locus of Power as empty (point de capiton): reinterprets the "empirical" fact of interregnum into a "transcendental" condition of the legitimate exercise of Power.
    * Everyone who occupies the locus of Power is by definition a usurper.
    * Locus of power changes into a purely symbolic construction that cannot be occupied by any real political agency.
    * Jacobins perceived themselves as protectors of the empty locus of Power, different from post-democratic "totalitarian" terror.
* Thin line between revolutionary hero and traitor who claims "special" place over ordinary citizens:* subject of enunciation/enunciated*:
    * Enunciated: Jacobins safeguard the emptiness of the locus of Power
    * Enunciation: their position is that of absolute Power: safeguarding the empty locus of Power is the most cunning and brutal way of occupying it.
* Hegel: the monarch is a positivization of the distance separating the locus of Power from those who exert it. The question of who should reign must be left to contingency of biological lineage to assert the utter insignificance of the positivity of the monarch.
    * The only way to bar political subjects from becoming "glued" to the locus of Power is to subjectivize the barrier in the person of monarch.
    * Monarch:
        * Enunciation: effective protector of the empty locus of Power by assuming
        * Enunciated: unitary, positive Person, guarantor and embodiment of the State's identity with itself.
* Hegel: a political movement gains victory when it splits.
    * The moment of liberal democracy's triumph over Communist "Evil Empire" is the moment of confrontation with its immanent limit: its weaknesses can no longer be exculpated by means of a comparison with "Them".
* Ethics of the Real: the duty of the Left is to keep alive the memory of all lost causes.
    * Ethics of Cause qua Thing.

**Hysterical ethical imperative** is to keep the desire alive at any price
* Every object is "not that!", set the desire in motion again.
* Anarchist radical Left, when far from power it can remain unsatisfied.

**Obsessional's imperative** is to guess and comply at any price the Other's demand.
* Obsessional is lost when there is no demand: the obsessional sacrifices himself, works for the Other, in order to prevent the appearance of the Other's desire.
* Social democratic ethics of compulsive satisfying the Other's (voter's) demands: "let us forget about great Goals".

**Pervert's imperative** is to work for the Other's enjoyment, to become an object-instrument of it.
* Stalinist pervert position of an instrument serving the enjoyment of the big Other of History.


**Ethics of drive**: ethical compulsion to mark repeatedly the memory of a lost Cause.
* NOT remembering the past trauma as exactly as possible since such documentation transforms trauma into a neutral objective fact.
* We have to mark repeatedly the trauma as such in its very "impossibility", non-integrated horror, by means of some "empty" symbolic gesture.
* Only possibility of attaining a distance on the present, a distance which will enable us to discern signs of the New.
