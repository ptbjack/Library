Marx: Man is an appendage of his destiny, of all the production. 

1:37:25 Senses and the history of the world graphic

Humanized nature is the contradiction between the interests of the companies and the workers.

Soul is not part of official language in Russian.

1:52:21 Comforting vs psychoanalysis

1:52:51 Eisenstein and Joyce met in Paris. The material says more then what that had to talk about. 

Joyce's freedom vs Eisenstein's freedom:
- Joyce is universal and ever changing: "Through Bloom I see the day as being universal."
- Eisenstein: freedom with numerous parameters of rules.
"Through the day, I see my object as being universal."

2:03:00 Marx's manifesto and Kapital, contrast between action vs impossibility of change. When coordinating actions, we need both the fatalistic and the rebellious aspect. 
- Injustice -- Stoic assessment-- "Let's get rid of it."

2:08:00 Modernity is not a summary concept.
- Marx: modern times began with abstract and general wealth
- How is the domain of human will? alienation.

2:11:00 Benjamin wrote "Das Kapital" from the perspective of the productive forces.

2:12:40 Marx saw sophism (dialectic) as a powerful weapon of enlightenment.

2:14:00 
Marx and Rosa Luxembourg and Antiquity:
- Rosa, Spartacus, minority of those who don't want to loot in war.
- Marx's reference to Antiquity is meant to prevent from ossification in ideology.
- A mistake from which you learn is better than a sound theory you can't test.
- Luhmann: Marxism will not repeat itself because it happened. Unscientific character of Marxism: If you tell people what situation they are in, they will react unexpectedly. If monkeys understood behavioral science, behavioral science would have a big problem. You don't need to show the truth of theory through using it, you have to force it.
- Mindset of tragedies in Greek antiquity; even if we know the consequences are/can be catastrophic, we learn from it.

Industrialization - March vs Russians - Leap
- How many people can I convince to leap with me and how can I convince them?
- Capital is a historical leap (creating abstract wealth)
