# Part 1 Republic (and the Multitude of the Poor)
## De Corpore 1: Biopolitics as Event

Third power in Foucault (aside from discipline and microphysical production) is **alternative production of subjectivity which seeks autonomy from power.**
- NOT resistance because resistance is too dependent on and subordinate to the power it opposes.

Two powers of life:
- Biopower - power over life
- **Biopolitics - power of life to resist and determine an alternative production of subjectivity.**

Ewald, Esposito analyze **normatice management of populatons**, normative sets which become more coherent the more microsystems are de-subjectivized and made homogeneous.
- Liberal image of Foucault, no alternative power or effective resistance.

Agamben: resistance acts only at the limit, margins of a totalitarian form.
- Qualitatively different forms of power.

**Biopolitics as fabric of events of freedom.**
- Foucault: power is exercized only over free subjects.
- 'intransigence of freedom' disrupts the normative system.
- The biopolitical event is also innovation which emerges from the inside.
	- *la parole* intervenes in and disrupts *la langue* as an event.
	- intervention as force of subjectification, new production of subjectivity.
- Singularity of event demonstrates the truth of the eternal.
	- **Materialist teleology** coincides with Nietzschean idea of **eternal return**.

Foucault vs Badiou:
- Badiou: an event acquires meaning *after* it takes place (Christ's crucifixion, French Revolution)
- Foucault: productivity of the event, forward-looking gaze. The event is inside existence.
- Without the internal logic of making events, one can only affirm them from the outside as a matter of faith. "I believe because it is absurd."

"Biopolitics is a partisan relationship between subjectivity and history that is crafted by a multitudinous strategy, events and resistances, articulated by a discourse that links political decision-making to the construction of bodies in struggle."
- Deleuze; biopolitics is "believing in the world"

Productive event, man becomes famale:
- Master Eckhart, God becomes fruitful in man.
- Schreber, Freud's patient dreaming of being impregnated by God.
- **The biopolitical event is always a queer event that shatters norms and identities.**

# Part 2 Modernity (And the Landscapes of Altermodernity)
## De Homine 1: Biopolitical Reason

The perspective of altermodernity lies in the rationality which extends beyond the reason/madness couple.
- Limitation of external rationality (of the colonized, of women) and foundation in identity: Harraway: every standpoind based in identity carries the **dream of returning to a Garden of Eden, site of absolute purity**.
	- risk of getting stuck in antimodernity.

Biopolitical reason:
- **the experience of the common**, the common cuts diagonally across the opposition universal/particular.
	- Spinoza: "common notions", productivity of the common through collective social practices.
	- The common lays claim to truth, truth is constructed from below.
- epistemology has to be grounded on the terrain of struggle.
	- anti → alter modernity is the **same struggle seen through a different attribute**, biopolitical struggle that produces at once a new reality and a new truth.

A **common subject** is formed in the critique of the objectivity of science and politics of truth.

Wittgenstein, language games and **forms of life**.
- Human beings agree on the language they use,
- Locates truth in on the fluid terrain of practice (knowing → doing)

**Making the common**: paradoxical position of common as a ground/presupposition that is also the result of the process.

Amerindian perspective: the point of view creates the subject, there is one culture (all animals are in some sense human) but many natures (occupying different worlds).
- Multinaturalism-- one epistemology, multiple ontologies.
- Perspective is not representation: the first is located in the body whereas the second is a property of the mind/spirit.

The common is composed of interactions among singularities.
- The common and singularity are mutually constitutive.

Biopolitical reason should be:
1. rationality at the service of life
2. technique at the service of ecological needs
3. accumulation of wealth at the service of the common

Terrain of collective practice, being-in-common → making the common.
- Truth can only be proclaimed out loud, it has to be acted: Spinoza: *experientia sive praxis* principle of truth formed by the activism of subjects who want to live a common life.

Strategic investigation as militancy, using Foucault's *dispositif*: material, social, affective and cognitive mechanisms active in the production of subjectivity.
- Dispositif is a formation that responds to a demand (urgence)
- Dispositif is always inscribed in a power relation, also always tied to limits of knowledge, which derive from it and also condition it.

Militant research; learning from movements, outside the university, online, nomad universities.
- Strategic investigation involves the production of knowledge through dispositifs. 
- Active engagement with the production of subjectivity in order to transform reality, ultimately production of new truths.
- You cannot talk about strategic investigation without doing it.
