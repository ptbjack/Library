# Introduction
“For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- Sublimation is satisfaction of the drive, without repression.
- Normally, we think of sublimations as substitute satisfactions for a missing sexual satisfaction.
- Lacan: the activity is different, yet the satisfaction is exactly the same.
	- The satisfaction in talking is itself “sexual”.
- The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.

Philosophy was eager to abandon notions such as the subject, object, truth, real, as belonging to its own metaphysical past, Lacan taught that these notions themselves are not problematic. The problematic is the disavowal or effacement of the inherent contradiction (antagonism) they all imply.

Lacan’s divide: psychoanalysis as a recognized therapeutic practice, confined to its field, and Lacan’s intellectual extravagances which were all over the place (philosophy, science etc.)

“Intellectualization” accusation: Lacan: “the unconscious thinks.”

Both philosophy and psychoanalysis recently has been avoiding an encounter with each other.

Sex is a concept that formulates a persisting contradiction of reality, this contradiction is involved in the very structuring of contradicting elements.
- Sex is of ontological relevance, not as an ultimate reality, but as an inherent twist of reality.

Althusser: Marx and psychoanalysis are situated within the conflict that they theorize. They are part of the reality that they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic. 
- Scientific objectivity is not a supposed neutrality, which is a dissimulation (perpetuation) of a given antagonism.
- In social conflict, “neutral” position is that of the ruling class, because it has achieved the status of the dominant ideology, strikes us as self-evident.
	- Objectivity is capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
- One cannot see everything from everywhere, some positions dissimulate the conflict, some reveal it.

# It's getting strange here
## DID SOMEBODY SAY SEX?

Freud: The Secret Passion (1962); Freud presents his theory of infantile sexuality, protest and shock ensues.
- We think that this because of Victorian morals and that now we know sexuality can be openly talked about. No, Shalev and Yerushalmi (2009) study: psychoanalytic psychotherapists confuse sexuality and romantic relationships, some cannot listen to talk about sex comfortably.
- Sexuality as defence against deeper issues about intimacy and self-identity

Systematic reduction of the notion of sexuality to “sexual practices” as constituting “sexual intercourse” and surrounded by obligatory sexual innuendo (sexual meanings).

For Freud, sexuality was the “deeper and more difficult issue” behind different sexual practices and meanings- inherently problematic, disruptive, rather than constructive of identities.
Always problematic and ontologically uncertain.
The sexual (constitutively deviational partial drives) is not the ultimate horizon of the “human” animal, or the anchor point of irreducible humanity, it is the operator of the inhuman, of dehumanization.
The sexual is that which makes us subjects, opens the perspective of the universal in psychoanalysis.

Contemporary psychotherapeutic take on sexuality:
1. Diverging from the Freudian notion of sexuality, one reduces it to a description of empirical features related to certain kinds of practice.
2. One dismissively discovers that sexuality is exactly what one has reduced it to; an overrated epiphenomenon.
There is no room left for psychoanalysis because psychoanalysis sees the impossibility of full sexual satisfaction as a constitutive and integral part of unconscious sexuality as such.

Sexual meaning is there to mask the reality of a more fundamental negativity at work in sexuality, to put up a screen that derives its efficacy from to the fact that it is itself a means of satisfaction -satisfaction through meaning, satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. 
The task of psychoanalysis is to deactivate this satisfaction, to restore sex in its dimension of the Real.

## WHERE DO ADULTS COME FROM?

Paradoxical status of infantile sexuality:
1. It exists
2. It exists in the absence of both biological and symbolic frameworks for its existence.
- Sensitivity of infantile sexuality is due to the proximity of it and adult sexuality. The “maturity” of sexual organs dramatically fails to make these organs function as exclusive sites of sexuality, or to produce a solid basis for clearly understanding and making sense of our sexuality.

[[Laplance]]: drive sexuality (le sexual) vs instinctual sexuality (le sexuel)
Le sexual: related to partial drives and their satisfaction, not innate, not object-based, not procreative.
Le sexuel: hormonally based, more or less preprogrammed. Arrives after puberty, after drive or infantile sexuality.
What is acquired through the drives precedes what is innate and instinctual.

Freud: “genital sexual organization” is far from being primordial.
- Involves unification of compound sexual drive.
- Always a forced and artificial unification
- Never fully achieved or accomplished
- “Normal” human sexuality is a paradoxical, artificial naturalization of the originally denatured drives.
- Human sexuality is “sexual” insofar as the unification at stake never really works, but allows for different partial drives to continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity.

Problems with this narrative:
- It advances from the supposedly original, free, and chaotic multiplicity of the drive to a forced sexual unification.
- It puts the “humanly” sexual of sexuality on the side of the drives as opposed to reproductive sexuality.
- It missed the point of encounter between enjoyment involved in the drives and sexuality
- According to this narrative, adult sexuality practices are also in infantile sexuality, indicates the existence of some kind of continuity.
- Leaves out the unconscious (ontological negativity).
- According to this narrative, infantile enjoyment is sexual because it is contaminated with “enigmatic signifiers”, unconscious and sexually charged messages of adults.
- Unconscious makes a pleasure “sexual”.
- What sexualizes infantile pleasure is the encounter with the unconscious of adults, a minus (something that comes only as missing from its place in the Other).

The unconscious starts with the repression as the signifying form pertaining to discursivity as such.
- Unconscious comes to us from the outside.
- Freud: actual repression is already based on repression; repression is constitutively redoubled.
- Lacan links it to the signifying structure and to a “necessary fall of the first signifier”, which coincides with the constitution of the subject: “the subject is constituted around the Urverdrangung.”

There is something about sexuality that appears only as repressed, something that registers in reality only in the form of repression (not as something that is, then repressed)

Much too simple opposition between the “subversive” chaotic multiplicity of the drives and “normative sexuality”. (progressive psychoanalytic explanation)
## CHRISTIANITY AND POLYMORPHOUS PERVERSITY

Common perception: cultural normativity promotes heterosexual intercourse and bans/represses drive sexuality (seen as perverse, asocial)
- Really? Christianity:
	- Christ is valued for his body, the body is the means by which communion in his presence is incorporation -oral drive. Its content has nothing to do with copulation.
	- Everything is exhibition of the body evoking jouissance without copulation.
	- There is nothing asocial in partial drives: they are the very stuff of communion.
	- Something disruptive at stake in “copulation”.
	- Christianity doesn’t need copulation. Even the “purest” sort of procreative sexual copulation is connected with sin.
		- St Augustine: sexuality is not the original sin (disobedience when eating from the tree of knowledge), it is the punishment for it, locus of its perpetuation. It is problematic enough to be seen as a punishment, a curse.
	- Procreative intercourse is banned from the religious imaginary
	- Stories of martyrdom are full of partial objects (Saint Agatha’s cut-off breasts).
	- In its libidinal aspect the Christian religion massively relies on what belongs to the register of “infantile sexuality”.
	- Pure enjoyment, “enjoyment for the sake of enjoyment,” is not banned. What is banned, or repressed, is its link to sexuality.
- Strong social pressure put on “natural sexuality” to function as the norm is there to hide an abyssal negativity of natural sexuality itself, more than to keep the supposedly disruptive partial drives away.
	- Nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our Other) in the first place. Culture is not something that denatures, splits natural sexuality; it is being generated at the very locus where something in nature (as sexual nature) is lacking.

Claim: there is no sexual instinct, no knowledge inherent to sexuality which would be able to reliably guide it.
- In the usual perspective; this lack of sexual instinct is perceived as something specifically human, induced by the human constitution (and the following culture).
	- Humanity as a deviation from Nature, from the Animal.
- Another perspective; humanity as that point of Nature where its lack of “knowledge” (of sexual law) acquires a singular epistemic form, the point of a specific articulation of Nature’s own inherent negativity.
	- What is the difference between the human animal and other (sexual) animals?
		- Human sexuality is the point at which the impossibility (ontological negativity) pertaining to the sexual relation appears as such, “registers” in reality as its part. It registers in the singular form of the unconscious.
		- Fundamental lack of knowledge, difference between two ways of not knowing:
			- Animals do not know that they do not know.
			- The human animal knows that it doesn’t know.
				- They are not simply not conscious of it, they are unconscious of it.
				- It involves not knowing that we know… that we don’t know.
					- Lacan: unconscious knowledge is a knowledge that does not know itself.
					- Unconscious is the form of existence of an ontological negativity pertaining to sexuality (“there is no sexual relation”).

What is being banned in Christianity?
- The ontological negativity of sexuation and sexuality as such.
- What is being banned is not the Signifier of the sexual (or its Image), but the (unconscious) knowledge of the nonexistence of such a Signifier.

What did Adam and Eve get to know when they ate from the tree of knowledge?
- Signifying structure of knowledge as such, the gap of the unconscious.
- The gap distinguishes knowledge from information or data.
- They were transmitted the gap of the Urverdrangung as constitutive of knowledge.
- When they ate, the result was an affect; they found the sight of their naked bodies shameful.
	- Shame is ontological: appears at the place of the lacking signifier (-1), because there is no signifier appears there.

Bible refers to sexual intercourse as “knowing the other”.
- “Knowing the other in the biblical sense” is to engage with the point in the Other were knowledge is lacking.
	- Sight of naked bodies is “shameful” because they fail to convey the sexual relation.
	- Sexuality on the level of the imaginary; we can only see bodies enjoying parts of other bodies.

The norm emerges at the point of this lack in representation; the norm takes the place of the image that “one has never seen”, that of a body completely wrapping itself around the Other’s body.
- The fantasy is sustained by the imposition of the norm, sustaining the norm in turn: the fantasy of sexual relation.

Non-relation is not the absence of relation, it is a real, the Real.
- The sexual relation of fantasy does not exist, the reality of partial drives and fleeting pleasures is not the ultimate raw reality, all there is.
- The lack of sexual relation is real in the sense that as lack of negativity, it is built into what is there, determining its logic and structure in an important way.
	- False opposition between full positivity of the drives and the negativity at work in sexuality.
- The fantasy and imperative of the relation comes from within the very structuring of the drives.
