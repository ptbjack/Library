# Introduction
“For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- Sublimation is satisfaction of the drive, without repression.
- Normally, we think of sublimations as substitute satisfactions for a missing sexual satisfaction.
- Lacan: the activity is different, yet the satisfaction is exactly the same.
	- The satisfaction in talking is itself “sexual”.
- The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.

Philosophy was eager to abandon notions such as the subject, object, truth, real, as belonging to its own metaphysical past, Lacan taught that these notions themselves are not problematic. The problematic is the disavowal or effacement of the inherent contradiction (antagonism) they all imply.

Lacan’s divide: psychoanalysis as a recognized therapeutic practice, confined to its field, and Lacan’s intellectual extravagances which were all over the place (philosophy, science etc.)

“Intellectualization” accusation: Lacan: “the unconscious thinks.”

Both philosophy and psychoanalysis recently has been avoiding an encounter with each other.

Sex is a concept that formulates a persisting contradiction of reality, this contradiction is involved in the very structuring of contradicting elements.
- Sex is of ontological relevance, not as an ultimate reality, but as an inherent twist of reality.

Althusser: Marx and psychoanalysis are situated within the conflict that they theorize. They are part of the reality that they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic. 
- Scientific objectivity is not a supposed neutrality, which is a dissimulation (perpetuation) of a given antagonism.
- In social conflict, “neutral” position is that of the ruling class, because it has achieved the status of the dominant ideology, strikes us as self-evident.
	- Objectivity is capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
- 
- One cannot see everything from everywhere, some positions dissimulate the conflict, some reveal it.
