# Introduction
“For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- Sublimation is satisfaction of the drive, without repression.
- Normally, we think of sublimations as substitute satisfactions for a missing sexual satisfaction.
- Lacan: the activity is different, yet the satisfaction is exactly the same.
	- The satisfaction in talking is itself “sexual”.
- The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.

Philosophy was eager to abandon notions such as the subject, object, truth, real, as belonging to its own metaphysical past, Lacan taught that these notions themselves are not problematic. The problematic is the disavowal or effacement of the inherent contradiction (antagonism) they all imply.

Lacan’s divide: psychoanalysis as a recognized therapeutic practice, confined to its field, and Lacan’s intellectual extravagances which were all over the place (philosophy, science etc.)

“Intellectualization” accusation: Lacan: “the unconscious thinks.”

Both philosophy and psychoanalysis recently has been avoiding an encounter with each other.

Sex is a concept that formulates a persisting contradiction of reality, this contradiction is involved in the very structuring of contradicting elements.
- Sex is of ontological relevance, not as an ultimate reality, but as an inherent twist of reality.

Althusser: Marx and psychoanalysis are situated within the conflict that they theorize. They are part of the reality that they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic. 
- Scientific objectivity is not a supposed neutrality, which is a dissimulation (perpetuation) of a given antagonism.
- In social conflict, “neutral” position is that of the ruling class, because it has achieved the status of the dominant ideology, strikes us as self-evident.
	- Objectivity is capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
- One cannot see everything from everywhere, some positions dissimulate the conflict, some reveal it.

# It's getting strange here
## DID SOMEBODY SAY SEX?

Freud: The Secret Passion (1962); Freud presents his theory of infantile sexuality, protest and shock ensues.
- We think that this because of Victorian morals and that now we know sexuality can be openly talked about. No, Shalev and Yerushalmi (2009) study: psychoanalytic psychotherapists confuse sexuality and romantic relationships, some cannot listen to talk about sex comfortably.
- Sexuality as defence against deeper issues about intimacy and self-identity

Systematic reduction of the notion of sexuality to “sexual practices” as constituting “sexual intercourse” and surrounded by obligatory sexual innuendo (sexual meanings).

For Freud, sexuality was the “deeper and more difficult issue” behind different sexual practices and meanings- inherently problematic, disruptive, rather than constructive of identities.
Always problematic and ontologically uncertain.
The sexual (constitutively deviational partial drives) is not the ultimate horizon of the “human” animal, or the anchor point of irreducible humanity, it is the operator of the inhuman, of dehumanization.
The sexual is that which makes us subjects, opens the perspective of the universal in psychoanalysis.

Contemporary psychotherapeutic take on sexuality:
1. Diverging from the Freudian notion of sexuality, one reduces it to a description of empirical features related to certain kinds of practice.
2. One dismissively discovers that sexuality is exactly what one has reduced it to; an overrated epiphenomenon.
There is no room left for psychoanalysis because psychoanalysis sees the impossibility of full sexual satisfaction as a constitutive and integral part of unconscious sexuality as such.

Sexual meaning is there to mask the reality of a more fundamental negativity at work in sexuality, to put up a screen that derives its efficacy from to the fact that it is itself a means of satisfaction -satisfaction through meaning, satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. 
The task of psychoanalysis is to deactivate this satisfaction, to restore sex in its dimension of the Real.

## WHERE DO ADULTS COME FROM?

Paradoxical status of infantile sexuality:
1. It exists
2. It exists in the absence of both biological and symbolic frameworks for its existence.
- Sensitivity of infantile sexuality is due to the proximity of it and adult sexuality. The “maturity” of sexual organs dramatically fails to make these organs function as exclusive sites of sexuality, or to produce a solid basis for clearly understanding and making sense of our sexuality.

[[Laplance]]: drive sexuality (le sexual) vs instinctual sexuality (le sexuel)
Le sexual: related to partial drives and their satisfaction, not innate, not object-based, not procreative.
Le sexuel: hormonally based, more or less preprogrammed. Arrives after puberty, after drive or infantile sexuality.
What is acquired through the drives precedes what is innate and instinctual.

Freud: “genital sexual organization” is far from being primordial.
- Involves unification of compound sexual drive.
- Always a forced and artificial unification
- Never fully achieved or accomplished
- “Normal” human sexuality is a paradoxical, artificial naturalization of the originally denatured drives.
- Human sexuality is “sexual” insofar as the unification at stake never really works, but allows for different partial drives to continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity.

Problems with this narrative:
- It advances from the supposedly original, free, and chaotic multiplicity of the drive to a forced sexual unification.
- It puts the “humanly” sexual of sexuality on the side of the drives as opposed to reproductive sexuality.
- It missed the point of encounter between enjoyment involved in the drives and sexuality
- According to this narrative, adult sexuality practices are also in infantile sexuality, indicates the existence of some kind of continuity.
- Leaves out the unconscious (ontological negativity).
- According to this narrative, infantile enjoyment is sexual because it is contaminated with “enigmatic signifiers”, unconscious and sexually charged messages of adults.
- Unconscious makes a pleasure “sexual”.
- What sexualizes infantile pleasure is the encounter with the unconscious of adults, a minus (something that comes only as missing from its place in the Other).

The unconscious starts with the repression as the signifying form pertaining to discursivity as such.
- Unconscious comes to us from the outside.
- Freud: actual repression is already based on repression; repression is constitutively redoubled.
- Lacan links it to the signifying structure and to a “necessary fall of the first signifier”, which coincides with the constitution of the subject: “the subject is constituted around the Urverdrangung.”

There is something about sexuality that appears only as repressed, something that registers in reality only in the form of repression (not as something that is, then repressed)

Much too simple opposition between the “subversive” chaotic multiplicity of the drives and “normative sexuality”. (progressive psychoanalytic explanation)
