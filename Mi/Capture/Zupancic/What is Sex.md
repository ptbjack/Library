# Introduction
“For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- Sublimation is satisfaction of the drive, without repression.
- Normally, we think of sublimations as substitute satisfactions for a missing sexual satisfaction.
- Lacan: the activity is different, yet the satisfaction is exactly the same.
	- The satisfaction in talking is itself “sexual”.
- The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.

Philosophy was eager to abandon notions such as the subject, object, truth, real, as belonging to its own metaphysical past, Lacan taught that these notions themselves are not problematic. The problematic is the disavowal or effacement of the inherent contradiction (antagonism) they all imply.

Lacan’s divide: psychoanalysis as a recognized therapeutic practice, confined to its field, and Lacan’s intellectual extravagances which were all over the place (philosophy, science etc.)

“Intellectualization” accusation: Lacan: “the unconscious thinks.”

Both philosophy and psychoanalysis recently has been avoiding an encounter with each other.

Sex is a concept that formulates a persisting contradiction of reality, this contradiction is involved in the very structuring of contradicting elements.
- Sex is of ontological relevance, not as an ultimate reality, but as an inherent twist of reality.

Althusser: Marx and psychoanalysis are situated within the conflict that they theorize. They are part of the reality that they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic. 
- Scientific objectivity is not a supposed neutrality, which is a dissimulation (perpetuation) of a given antagonism.
- In social conflict, “neutral” position is that of the ruling class, because it has achieved the status of the dominant ideology, strikes us as self-evident.
	- Objectivity is capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
- One cannot see everything from everywhere, some positions dissimulate the conflict, some reveal it.

# 1 It's getting strange here
## DID SOMEBODY SAY SEX?

Freud: The Secret Passion (1962); Freud presents his theory of infantile sexuality, protest and shock ensues.
- We think that this because of Victorian morals and that now we know sexuality can be openly talked about. No, Shalev and Yerushalmi (2009) study: psychoanalytic psychotherapists confuse sexuality and romantic relationships, some cannot listen to talk about sex comfortably.
- Sexuality as defence against deeper issues about intimacy and self-identity

Systematic reduction of the notion of sexuality to “sexual practices” as constituting “sexual intercourse” and surrounded by obligatory sexual innuendo (sexual meanings).

For Freud, sexuality was the “deeper and more difficult issue” behind different sexual practices and meanings- inherently problematic, disruptive, rather than constructive of identities.
Always problematic and ontologically uncertain.
The sexual (constitutively deviational partial drives) is not the ultimate horizon of the “human” animal, or the anchor point of irreducible humanity, it is the operator of the inhuman, of dehumanization.
The sexual is that which makes us subjects, opens the perspective of the universal in psychoanalysis.

Contemporary psychotherapeutic take on sexuality:
1. Diverging from the Freudian notion of sexuality, one reduces it to a description of empirical features related to certain kinds of practice.
2. One dismissively discovers that sexuality is exactly what one has reduced it to; an overrated epiphenomenon.
There is no room left for psychoanalysis because psychoanalysis sees the impossibility of full sexual satisfaction as a constitutive and integral part of unconscious sexuality as such.

Sexual meaning is there to mask the reality of a more fundamental negativity at work in sexuality, to put up a screen that derives its efficacy from to the fact that it is itself a means of satisfaction -satisfaction through meaning, satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. 
The task of psychoanalysis is to deactivate this satisfaction, to restore sex in its dimension of the Real.

## WHERE DO ADULTS COME FROM?

Paradoxical status of infantile sexuality:
1. It exists
2. It exists in the absence of both biological and symbolic frameworks for its existence.
- Sensitivity of infantile sexuality is due to the proximity of it and adult sexuality. The “maturity” of sexual organs dramatically fails to make these organs function as exclusive sites of sexuality, or to produce a solid basis for clearly understanding and making sense of our sexuality.

[[Laplance]]: drive sexuality (le sexual) vs instinctual sexuality (le sexuel)
Le sexual: related to partial drives and their satisfaction, not innate, not object-based, not procreative.
Le sexuel: hormonally based, more or less preprogrammed. Arrives after puberty, after drive or infantile sexuality.
What is acquired through the drives precedes what is innate and instinctual.

Freud: “genital sexual organization” is far from being primordial.
- Involves unification of compound sexual drive.
- Always a forced and artificial unification
- Never fully achieved or accomplished
- “Normal” human sexuality is a paradoxical, artificial naturalization of the originally denatured drives.
- Human sexuality is “sexual” insofar as the unification at stake never really works, but allows for different partial drives to continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity.

Problems with this narrative:
- It advances from the supposedly original, free, and chaotic multiplicity of the drive to a forced sexual unification.
- It puts the “humanly” sexual of sexuality on the side of the drives as opposed to reproductive sexuality.
- It missed the point of encounter between enjoyment involved in the drives and sexuality
- According to this narrative, adult sexuality practices are also in infantile sexuality, indicates the existence of some kind of continuity.
- Leaves out the unconscious (ontological negativity).
- According to this narrative, infantile enjoyment is sexual because it is contaminated with “enigmatic signifiers”, unconscious and sexually charged messages of adults.
- Unconscious makes a pleasure “sexual”.
- What sexualizes infantile pleasure is the encounter with the unconscious of adults, a minus (something that comes only as missing from its place in the Other).

The unconscious starts with the repression as the signifying form pertaining to discursivity as such.
- Unconscious comes to us from the outside.
- Freud: actual repression is already based on repression; repression is constitutively redoubled.
- Lacan links it to the signifying structure and to a “necessary fall of the first signifier”, which coincides with the constitution of the subject: “the subject is constituted around the Urverdrangung.”

There is something about sexuality that appears only as repressed, something that registers in reality only in the form of repression (not as something that is, then repressed)

Much too simple opposition between the “subversive” chaotic multiplicity of the drives and “normative sexuality”. (progressive psychoanalytic explanation)
## CHRISTIANITY AND POLYMORPHOUS PERVERSITY

Common perception: cultural normativity promotes heterosexual intercourse and bans/represses drive sexuality (seen as perverse, asocial)
- Really? Christianity:
	- Christ is valued for his body, the body is the means by which communion in his presence is incorporation -oral drive. Its content has nothing to do with copulation.
	- Everything is exhibition of the body evoking jouissance without copulation.
	- There is nothing asocial in partial drives: they are the very stuff of communion.
	- Something disruptive at stake in “copulation”.
	- Christianity doesn’t need copulation. Even the “purest” sort of procreative sexual copulation is connected with sin.
		- St Augustine: sexuality is not the original sin (disobedience when eating from the tree of knowledge), it is the punishment for it, locus of its perpetuation. It is problematic enough to be seen as a punishment, a curse.
	- Procreative intercourse is banned from the religious imaginary
	- Stories of martyrdom are full of partial objects (Saint Agatha’s cut-off breasts).
	- In its libidinal aspect the Christian religion massively relies on what belongs to the register of “infantile sexuality”.
	- Pure enjoyment, “enjoyment for the sake of enjoyment,” is not banned. What is banned, or repressed, is its link to sexuality.
- Strong social pressure put on “natural sexuality” to function as the norm is there to hide an abyssal negativity of natural sexuality itself, more than to keep the supposedly disruptive partial drives away.
	- Nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our Other) in the first place. Culture is not something that denatures, splits natural sexuality; it is being generated at the very locus where something in nature (as sexual nature) is lacking.

Claim: there is no sexual instinct, no knowledge inherent to sexuality which would be able to reliably guide it.
- In the usual perspective; this lack of sexual instinct is perceived as something specifically human, induced by the human constitution (and the following culture).
	- Humanity as a deviation from Nature, from the Animal.
- Another perspective; humanity as that point of Nature where its lack of “knowledge” (of sexual law) acquires a singular epistemic form, the point of a specific articulation of Nature’s own inherent negativity.
	- What is the difference between the human animal and other (sexual) animals?
		- Human sexuality is the point at which the impossibility (ontological negativity) pertaining to the sexual relation appears as such, “registers” in reality as its part. It registers in the singular form of the unconscious.
		- Fundamental lack of knowledge, difference between two ways of not knowing:
			- Animals do not know that they do not know.
			- The human animal knows that it doesn’t know.
				- They are not simply not conscious of it, they are unconscious of it.
				- It involves not knowing that we know… that we don’t know.
					- Lacan: unconscious knowledge is a knowledge that does not know itself.
					- Unconscious is the form of existence of an ontological negativity pertaining to sexuality (“there is no sexual relation”).

What is being banned in Christianity?
- The ontological negativity of sexuation and sexuality as such.
- What is being banned is not the Signifier of the sexual (or its Image), but the (unconscious) knowledge of the nonexistence of such a Signifier.

What did Adam and Eve get to know when they ate from the tree of knowledge?
- Signifying structure of knowledge as such, the gap of the unconscious.
- The gap distinguishes knowledge from information or data.
- They were transmitted the gap of the Urverdrangung as constitutive of knowledge.
- When they ate, the result was an affect; they found the sight of their naked bodies shameful.
	- Shame is ontological: appears at the place of the lacking signifier (-1), because there is no signifier appears there.

Bible refers to sexual intercourse as “knowing the other”.
- “Knowing the other in the biblical sense” is to engage with the point in the Other where knowledge is lacking.
	- Sight of naked bodies is “shameful” because they fail to convey the sexual relation.
	- Sexuality on the level of the imaginary; we can only see bodies enjoying parts of other bodies.

The norm emerges at the point of this lack in representation; the norm takes the place of the image that “one has never seen”, that of a body completely wrapping itself around the Other’s body.
- The fantasy is sustained by the imposition of the norm, sustaining the norm in turn: the fantasy of sexual relation.

Non-relation is not the absence of relation, it is a real, the Real.
- The sexual relation of fantasy does not exist, the reality of partial drives and fleeting pleasures is not the ultimate raw reality, all there is.
- The lack of sexual relation is real in the sense that as lack of negativity, it is built into what is there, determining its logic and structure in an important way.
	- False opposition between full positivity of the drives and the negativity at work in sexuality.
- The fantasy and imperative of the relation comes from within the very structuring of the drives.


# 2 ... and even stranger out there
## THE QUANDARY OF THE RELATION

Politics refers to what can be articulated around some fundamental social antagonism.

Politics and psychoanalysis:

* One tends to leave sexuality out
* Or, Western ideology; combination of moral liberalism and political conservatism
* Both mistaken:
    * First dismisses sexuality as *something* that has a secondary, regional relevance.
    * Second dismisses politics as *something* that is necessarily pathological.
    * "Something", the Real is precisely not being, but its inherent impasse.

Lacanian concept of the sexual does not provide the best description of a certain reality, since it does not have to do with sexual content. But, beyond sexual content and practices, the sexual is not a pure form, it refers to the absence of this form, as that which curves and defines the space of the sexual.

Sex vs unicorns:

* Unicorn, we have the idea, but it is nowhere to be found empirically.
* Sex, we recognize empirically, but we don't have the Idea of sex (Plato), its essence.
    * Presenting sex as low and "dirty" is already a response to a fundamental scandal - that we don't know what it is.
    * There is sex only in something that does not work.
    * Culture is not simply a mask/veil of the sexual, it is the mask for something in the sexual which "is not".
        * Freud: civilization is sexually driven; it is driven by that which is not.

That which is not in the sexual is the relation: *there is no sexual relation*.

* We conclude hastily as: the ontologically stated non-relation is seen as the obstacle to the formation of any "successful" concrete, empirical relationship.
* Lacan's point: it is only the inexistence of the relation that opens up the space for relationships and ties as we know them.
    * Non-relation is the inherent logic of the relationships that are possible and existing.
    * Biased by its constitutive negativity, this structure is always more or less than the sum of its elements.
    * The impossible substance of enjoyment = object a, objective counterpart of the non-relation (non-relation as object).
    * Object-disoriented ontology, ontology as "disoriented" by the object a.

"The sexual is political", as in, a true emancipatory politics can be thought only on the ground of an "object-disoriented ontology": ontology that does not purse being qua being, but but the crack (the Real, the antagonism) that haunts being from within.
## THE ANTI-SEXUS

Andrei Platonov's text. In its introduction, Aaron Schuster:

* Is sexuality to be liberated, or is humanity liberated from sexuality? Is sexuality the object of or the obstacle to emancipation?

Emancipation is most often conceived in terms of freeing ourselves from the social non-relation, Lacan says the opposite: the aim to abolish the non-relation is the trademark of all social repression.
* Oppressive societies: if there is to be a relation, women need to be such and such.
	* Oppressive society forces the impossible.
* Psychoanalysis: Woman does not exist.

Contemporary "secular" form of social order and domination abandoned the idea of a harmonious totality to the advantage of the idea of a non-totalizable multiplicity of singularities forming a "democratic" network.

Lacan: there is no neutrality of social being, social being is fundamentally biased.
* Discursive space is biased by the missing element of the relation.
* Neutral social being represses consequential negativity. It is another form of the narrative of the relation, it is accompanied by the idea of some kind of self-regulation.
    * E.g. "the invisible hand of the market"

Non-relation is a priory, appears with every empirical relation as inherent to its structure.
* Choice is not between relation and non-relation, it is between different kinds of relations that are being formed in the discursive space curved by the non-relation.

Anti-Sexus:

* Presupposition:
    * Sexuality is problematic because it involves the unpredictable Other. At the same time, sex stands in the way of good social relations.
        * The Anti-Sexus can distillate the pure essence of sex, and provide "Other-free" enjoyment, at the same time create real, lasting bonds (pure spiritual friendship).
* Two aims:
    * To extract sex from the Other
        * Pure substance of sex
    * To exempt the Other from sex
        * Sexless Other
* The crucial obstacle to global human emancipation is humanity itself, to solve it, Anti-Sexus proposes to canalize the disruptive element.
    * The disruptive element is not an element
    * Anti-Sexus only provides to remove the Other from sex, not a method to remove sex from the Other.
        * The Other is sexless if he or she is being masturbated most of the time.

"To make oneself masturbated"- Lacan's conceptualization of the drive.

* Instead of active or passive, something active in the heart of passivity, and vice versa.
    * E.g. scopic drive, to make oneself seen.
* The formula of the nonexistent "sexual drive".

The Other and enjoyment like matryoshka:

* Enjoyment is "in" the Other, but when we look "in" the enjoyment, there is also the Other "in" it.
* Also the non-relation between the subject and the Other.
    * If enjoyment is what disturbs this relation, it does so by implicating, placing them one in the other, not by coming between them (holding them apart).
* All enjoyment already presupposes the Other, regardless of whether we "get it" with the help of the "real other" (another person) or not.
* There is no enjoyment without the Other, because all enjoyment originates at the place of the Other (as the locus of the signifiers).
    * Innermost enjoyment can only occur at that "extimate" place.
    * Radical heterogeneity, antagonism between the signifier and enjoyment is not due to their heterogeneous origins, but to the fact that they originate at the same place.
    * The Other is both the locus of the signifier and the locus of enjoyment.

Relation between enjoyment and sexuality exposes the non-relation at the very heart of every relation.
## THE INVISIBLE 'HANDJOB' OF THE MARKET

The non-relation is at work in all forms of social bond.

* In the field of love, the relation stops not being written from time to time.
* Social relations of power- domination, exploitation, discrimination- are forms of exploitation of the non-relation.

Abolishing the non-relation: emancipatory projects of 'new order', attempting to force the non-relation out of the social equation.

Vs.

Exploitation of the non-relation: 'narratives of the Relation', present a given form of social antagonism as the ultimate Relation, supposedly protecting us from the utter Chaos of the non-relation.

* Social injustice → higher Justice
* 
* Actual, concrete exploitation is based on this appropriation of "privatization of the negative."
* E.g. capitalism:
    * Starts off with two revolutionary ideas: "the economic Relation does not exist" and "the non-relation could be very profitable".
    * The non-relation is profitable, it is the ultimate source of growth and profit.
    * Adam Smith:
        * Non-relation is a fundamental state
        * Individuals are driven by egotistic drives and the pursuit of self-interest, by ruthlessly pursuing one's own interest, one promotes the good of society as a whole much more efficiently that when one sets off to promote it directly.
            * What we find at the very core of the most selfish individual enjoyment is actually the Other.
        * Mistake: what we find at the core of this Other is a most "masturbatory self-enjoyment. Not only individuals never do what we think we are doing, the Other and its invisible hand also do not do only what they think they are doing.
            * The invisible hand of the market is always already the invisible handjob of the market, putting most of the wealth decidedly out of common reach.
    * Everybody is living better than two centuries ago, yet the price of this modern economic higher Relation is that the differences between the rich and poor are exponentially greater, fed by the non-relation in its "higher" form.
    * In order for the non-relation to be profitable, it has to be built into the very mode of production.
        * Marx: money → capital. What makes the products (labor power) also appears with them on the market as one of the products, objects for sale.
        * Capitalism exploits the point of negativity of the social order, capitalists are not "stealing" from the workers, they are employing them to make the negativity/entropy of the system work for them. They are making themselves enriched.
    * Labor power as commodity is the point that marks the constitutive negativity, gap, of this system: the point where one thing immediately falls into other (use value → source of value).
        * Labor power has no use value, it leaps over to the source of value.
        * "The Worker does not exist." What exists is the person whose work is sold and bought.
            * A Worker that existed would actually be a slave.
            * The proletariat is not simply one of the social classes, it names the point of the concrete constitutive negativity in capitalism.
                * Not the sum of all workers, the concept names the symptomatic point of this system, its disavowed and exploited negativity.


# 3 Contradictions that matter
## SEX OR GENDER

Psychoanalysis relates sexuality to an epistemological difficulty, with immanent ontological relevance. What is sexuality?

* The problematic territory of being that seems to throw us out of joint, disorient us, and make us indulge in things characteristic of human society (politics, art, science, love, religion...)
* The reason why sexuality is closely related to the unconscious and to the mechanisms of repression is not its moral controversy, but_ its paradoxical ontological status_, manifesting itself as an _epistemological limit_.
    * Moral issues originate from its ontological problem.
* Introduces us to the lack of the last instance.

Sexuality as an immediate political problem.
* Feminism: always been political movement.
    * Depends on positing sexual difference as a political problem, and hence on situating it in the context of social antagonism and of emancipatory struggle.
    * Doesn't try to affirm some other, female identity, starts from the fact that "women" were nonexistent in a political sense.
        * Nonexistence functioned as a homogeneity of the political space, feminism transformed it into a split which concerns all.
        * Split is not independently existing ontological divide (men vs women) but something that constitutes sexual difference as difference.
            * Traditional division between masculine and feminine worlds does not see sexual difference as difference. Unity is not threatened by this "difference".
    * Female identity sustains exclusion.
        * Emancipatory politics begins with "loss of identity", which is good.
    * Capacity to inscribe the problem of division and difference into the world the homogeneity of which is based on exclusion.
        * Exclusion of the split as such, erasing of a social antagonism.
* Sexual difference is not that between different identities, but as an ontological impossibility (implied in sexuality) which opens up the space of the social (where identities are also generated).
    * Ontologically determinative negativity, lost with its replacement with "gender differences."
        * Joan Copjec: gender theory removed the sex from sex: the sex of sexual difference dropped out when this term was replaced by gender.

Sex as the subject of ontological inquiry.

* Primitive science as a sexual technique; ontologies used to rely on sexual difference (ying-yang, water-fire etc.)
    * Sexual difference anchored in essentialism.
    * Traditional ontology was a machine for producing "masculine" and "feminine" essences, or, for grounding these essences in being.
* Modern science and philosophy "desexualized" reality, abandoned sexual difference as the organizing principle of reality.
    * Break with ontology tout court: modern science is not ontology, does not pretend to make ontological claims, _it also does not recognize that it is nevertheless making them._
    * Kant, if one can have no knowledge about things in themselves, the classical ontological of being qua being seems to lose its ground.
* Lacan and Freud on the same line with modern science; desexualization.
    * Lacan: psychoanalysis proceeds from the same status as Science itself. It implies no recognition of any substance on which it claims to operate, even that of sexuality.
    * The sexual in psychoanalysis is different form the sense-making combinatory game, it is something that disrupts this game and makes it impossible.
    * Psychoanalysis is coextensive with desexualization of reality, and absolutely uncompromising when it comes to the sexual as the irreducible Real (not substance).
        * Reduction of sex and the sexual to the point of ontological inconsistency, which, as such, is irreducible.

Non-relationship between psychoanalysis and ontology.
* "Gender is social construct" is deadlocked, remains in the dichotomy nature/culture.
* Butler: gender is performative; actions create the essences that they express. Nothing preexists.
    * Dynamics of repetition opens up the only margin of freedom.
    * Performativity is different from linguistics in terms of time. Socio-symbolic constructs, through repetition, become nature.
        * Dialectics of nature and culture → internal dialectics of culture. Culture both produces and regulates "nature".
    * Performativity is a kind of onto-logy of the discursive, responsible for both the* logos* and the *being* of things.
* Lacanian psychoanalysis seems compatible with performativity but is irreducibly different:
    * Not only does it have to take into account the real, Lacan takes the signifying order as the locus of a fundamental *split*.
    * The signifying order creates its own space, but something else gets added to it; something parasitic on performative productivity, produced with it and "on top of" it.
        * Collateral for the symbolic
        * The signifier also "produces" the dimension of the Real, related to the points of structural impossibility/contradiction of symbolic reality itself.
        * This is the dimension that sustains the "vital" phenomena (libido or jouissance, drive, sexualized body) in their out-of-jointness with the symbolic.
        * Responsible for the fact that the field of the Other is never neutral (or structured by pure differentiality), but conflictual, asymmetrical, "not-all", ridden with a fundamental antagonism.
            * Antagonism as such is not *between* different elements, it is the structuring principle of the elements involved in it.
        * The signifying structure is coextensive with a gap.
        * Lacan: implication of discursivity and gap = signifier of the lack in the other.
            * The signifying order emerges as already lacking one signifier, it appears with the lack of a signifier "built into it" (*lack of "binary signifier"*)
            * The signifying order begins not with One or multiplicity. It begins with a "minus one".
        * In the place of the gap, *surplus-enjoymen*t appears and stains the signifying structure: it is the heterogeneous element.
        * Enjoyment marks (curves) the signifying order by sticking to a certain set of signifiers that relate in some way to the lack of the signifier.
        * The way enjoyment relates to the signifying order passes through the negativity (minus one).
            * This negativity is the Real of the junction between the missing signifier and enjoyment;* this configuration is sexuality*.
    * Sexuality is not a being that exists beyond the symbolic: it exists as the contradiction of the symbolic space that appears because of the constitutively missing signifier and enjoyment that appears at its place.
    * Human sexuality is the placeholder of the missing signifier. It is a mess that compensates for the sexual relation as impossible (to be written).
        * Messiness is result of the attempt to invent a logic at the very point of the impasse of such logic.
    * *Formulas of sexuation *restate the issue of sexuality and "sexual relations" as a logical problem (problem of the signifying logic) out of which it springs.
    * Lacan: being vs the Real.
        * The Real is not a being but it is its deadlock.
        * All being is symbolic; being in the Other.
        * There is only being in the symbolic, except that there is the Real, which exists only as the inherent contradiction of symbolic being.
    * Copjec: sex is the impossibility of completing meaning, not (Butler:) a meaning that is incomplete. Language is structurally incomplete, not sex. 
* In order to speak of being qua being, one has to amputate, eradicate a negativity (contradiction as such). Being qua being is not elementary given, it is already a result which presupposes a previous step of losing the Real.
* Concept of the Real is lost when sex → gender.
    * Genders are said to *be*, or to exist.

## SEXUAL DIVISION, A PROBLEM IN ONTOLOGY

What is the relationship between sexual difference and sexuality?

* Freud: the sexual drive is independent of its object; its origin is not due to its object's attractions.
    * The exclusive sexual interest felt by men for women is also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a self-evident fact based upon an attraction that is ultimately of a chemical nature.
    * Original nonexistence of any germ of two sexes during preadolescence.
        * Auto-erotic activity of the erotogenic zones is the same in both sexes.
        * Libido is invariably of a masculine nature, whether it occurs in men or in women and irrespectively of whether its object is a man or a woman.
            * Masculinity and Femininity are just ideals that exist nowhere in reality.
            * If pure Masculinity and pure Femininity existed, their sexuality would be one and the same ("masculine")
    * Sexual difference does not arise from there being two sexes or two sexualities, but from the fact that there is no "second sex", and from an enigmatic indifference of the "sexual thing" (polymorphically perverse autoeroticism) that appears at the point of the "missing sex".
        * What splits into two is the very nonexistence of the one (the one which would be the Other).

Early Lacan vs late Lacan

* Early: The presence of the signifier induces irredeemable loss on the part of the human animal: once it is articulated in the signifier as "demand", need is irreversibly alienated.
    * The presence of the signifier deviates man's need: when subjected to demand, needs come back to him in an alienated form.
    * What is alienated in needs constitutes *primal repression*, as it cannot be articulated in demand.
        * Nevertheless appears in an offshoot:* desire*.
    * Phallus designates "meaning effects as a whole".
* Late: signifying order is coextensive with a lack.
    * There is no another side of the signifier (pure organic need), it has a reverse side.
    * The minus is the foundation (of the One of the signifying order).
    * Change in mythology.
        * Nature is not interrupted with the emergence of the signifier.
        * Human story begins with the emergence of the signifier, one signifier "gone missing".
            * Speech is already a response to the missing signifier, which is not (there).
            * The condition of speech is  "one-signifier-less".
    * Signifying structure emerges with-without one signifier, this "hole" has consequences and determines what gets structures around it.
    * Coffee without cream/without milk joke: the waiter's response introduces paradoxical spectral entity in the very dimension of negativity.
        * "Without" = "with the lack of"
    * Closer to Hegel  than early period of Lacan.
    * Closer to Freud than early period of Lacan.
        * Freud: the "human deviation" starts with a surplus-enjoyment, there not being a natural need pure, devoid of surplus element which splits it from within.
        * Lacan complements Freud with the theory of the lack of one signifier as the other side of the surplus-enjoyment which pertains to the satisfaction of all our needs.
    * Primal repression belongs to the signifying structure itself, it appears as "one with" the originally missing signifier, as synonymously with the structure with-without.

Sexual difference, or division, originates in this ontological deficit.

* What splits into two is the very nonexistence of the one (of the one which, if it existed, would be the radically Other). What splits in two is the very "one that lacks", the minus, the with-without.
* Formulas of sexuation are two ways in which the constitutive minus of the signifying order is inscribed in the order itself and dealt with.
    * Phallic function (*ϕ* x) marks the constitutive minus of the symbolic order.
        * Universal function, prerogative of subjectivity as such, yet there is nothing sexually neutral about its operation, it always follows the logic of this or that (sexed) position, does not exist as a neutral foundation (zero level of subjectivity).
    * There is no subjectivity beyond (or simply outside) the sexual division.
        * Sexual difference is not a secondary distinction of subjectivity, or simply culturally constructed.
* Like Kant's antinomies of reason; difference or contradiction does not exists between the two sides or positions (as in difference between man and woman). The two positions are parallel configurations of a difference or contradiction of the signifying order itself, which they logically decline in different ways (each one producing the fundamental contradiction in its own way).
* Phallus is not a differentiating feature, it is the signifier of the difference as such.
* Sexual difference is a difference in configuring the minus marked by the phallic function as the function of castration.

Formulas of Sexuation
![[formulas-of-sexuation.png]]
* Left side is masculine side
    * Posits that there exists One that is not castrated (has access to full enjoyment, e.g. the primordial Father, the Woman)
    * The exclusion of this One is the way in which the subject emerging on this side appropriates the minus involved in the signifying order.
        * The negative reference point is constitutive, permits everything else to be constituted as such, as a whole: all x are subject to the function of castration.
        * E.g. primordial father: the exception (the "killing") of the One frames the renunciation common to all.
    * Castration: to give up what one never had, to transform the "minus one" which comes with the signifying order into something that we have renounced.
    * "Negative quantity" of the signifier, the lack of the signifier gets a signifier called *Phallus *(*ϕ*, master signifier, S1).
        * Assuming castration by relying on the phallus, assuming the lack in the Other by repressing it.
    * Subject relies on *ϕ *and establishes a relation to the Other in the guise of the small *a* on the right-hand side of the formulas.
        * The One (cut out) provides the signifying frame, the "window of fantasy", through which the other can appear as desirable (as object-cause of desire).
        * Lacan: man never deals with anything by way of a partner but object *a* inscribed on the other side of the bar.
            * E.g. *Rear Window*, fiancée is desirable only when she enters the frame of the window.
* Right side is feminine side.
    * Castration does not rely for the feminine subject on the exclusion (exception) of the non-castrated Other.
    * Castration does not allow for any exception.
    * Not all x are subject to castration. (we cannot speak of "all" women or, simply, of *the* woman)
    * Juncture of two claims:
        * Woman is the Other, in the most radical sense, in the sexual relationship.
        * There is no Other of the Other.
            * If the woman is the Other of man, man is not the Other of woman.
            * The relationship to the Other is included in the Other, it is "part" of the Other.
    * Woman thinks of the Other as part of the rule, as included in the rule.
    * Not-all: the nonexistence of the Other is itself inscribed into the Other.
        * Unconscious: not a point of self-reflective transparency, but a signifying gap constitutive of knowledge.
        * Barred Other is not simply lacking other, but the Other the inconsistency of which is inscribed in it, has a marker in it.
        * *S(Ⱥ): woman's jouissance:* enjoyment appearing at the place of the gap of the non-emergence of one signifier is that of the unconscious, not as repressed, but as the very substance of the missing signifier which, as missing, gives its form to the unconscious.
        * Limits of knowledge: one cannot know anything about the other's enjoyment, this enjoyment is not an object of knowledge because it is a place-holder for the knowledge which does not exist.
            * This enjoyment appears because there is nothing to know there.
            * _Woman's jouissance is the signifier of the lack of knowledge (in the Other); marks the point where the Other does not know._
            * "Feminine jouissance" is not an obstacle to the sexual relation, but a symptom of its nonexistence.
    * Woman also has relation with the signifier of castration *ϕ: *since the woman has a relationship with *S(Ⱥ)*, she is redoubled, not-whole, since she can also have a relation with *ϕ.*
        * Relation with the signifier *ϕ *is that on which existence is founded for any speaking being.
        * Relation with *S(Ⱥ) *puts us on the path of "ex-sistence".
        * Woman is fully in the phallic function, but there is something else which comes with the position of being the Other in the sexual relation, this supplement (relation with *S(Ⱥ)*) makes her relation with *ϕ *different than in the case of a man.
            * Woman cannot rely on a constitutive exception, but relies on a constitutive *deception*.
            * Riviere: femininity as such is nothing but the susceptibility to wear femininity as a mask (to wear castration as a mask). There is no "true femininity" as opposed to femininity as masquerade.
            * The essence of femininity is to pretend to be a woman.
        * Castration is not repressed, neither is it assumed as something empirical.
    * The phallic function is not masculine: what we perceive as "masculinity" and "femininity" are different ways of its deployment. "Putting it on" suggests femininity.
    * "Feminine anxiety": anxiety pertaining to femininity as essentially a masquerade.
        * Not a dread of being punished for stealing the father's property, but more fundamentally, the anxiety of literally *being nothing*.
        * The subject hinges on the mask, under the mask, there is nothing but sheer ontological anxiety.
        * Lacan: this radical ontological anxiety is the prerogative of subjectivity as such. Subject as such is feminine.
            * Man believes that he is (exists), "male anxiety" usually stops at castration anxiety. Man is the subject who believes he is man. Masculinity is a question of belief based on, and sustained by, the repression of castration.
* Masculinity is a matter of belief, femininity is a matter of pretense.
* Subjects are not constructed by language; they are produced as a response to its inherent limit, and the unexpected plus appearing at this limit.

Lacan criticizes structural linguistics.
* Saussure: S/s (signifier over signified).
* Emphasis on pure differentiality. Saussure: in language there are only differences without positive terms, signifiers "make sense", produce meaning, only as parts of differential networks of places, binary oppositions, etc.
* Emphasis on the arbitrariness of the sign: the signifying chain is separated from the signified, which is what the par in the Saussurean algorithm indicates.
    * Lacan: algorithm sustains the illusion that the signifier serves the function of representing the signified, it has to justify its existence in terms of some signification.

![[2020-12-27_173829.png]]
Erroneous conception: the signifier "tree" serves to represent some signification.
* It is not enough to assert that there is no connection between the two levels (would remain the enigmatic sign of a total mystery)
* Lacan: the signifier "enters the signified", the bar between them does not exactly prevent that.
    * With-without: the signifier does not represent a signified, nor is it simply "an enigmatic sign of a total mystery", it is with-without the signified (as the binary signifier).
    * The lack of the relation (bar between the two levels) is* inherent to* the signifier (and the signifying order) as such.
        * Not incapacity of the signifier, but language's inherent minus and contradiction.
    * A signifier is linked to another by the negativity of with-without: this is the gap inherent to the signifying order where Lacan situates the subject of the unconscious.
        * Binding negativity: "a signifier represents the subject for another signifier".
        * With-out is the formula of the unconscious, of the form of the unconscious.
* Saussure: in language, everything is based on relations, pure relational differentiality.
    * Lacan: pure relational differentiality can only be based on a non-relation, on *a different kind of difference.*
        * The one (of the binary relation) has to be missing.

The real of sexual division is linked to the point of the "missing one".
![[2020-12-27_175917.png]]
* We have differentiality (two different signifiers), but there is nothing different in the realities to which they refer.
    * Not one reality, reality as split.
* Example of the presuppositions of the functioning of the signifier.
    * "Ladies and gentlemen" as example of the constitutive gap and contradiction at the core of the signifying logic.
* Train window, brother - sister example: they cannot agree where they are.
    * Sexual difference is the consequence of the the fact that something is lacking in the signifying order (at the same time, there is something excessive in it- surplus-enjoyment).
    * Difference has no ground: there is no "two homelands", their homeland is one and the same: this oneness and sameness is the oneness and sameness of pure difference.
* Heteronomy is not that between Ladies and Gentlemen, but between language as a system of differences and the object-like surplus (a) appearing at the place of the constitutive minus of this system, spoiling its pure differentiality.
    * Sexual difference is difference in the configuration of this "spoiling".
* Speech in psychoanalysis: not only laws of pure differentiality;
    * Also sonorous similarities or homonyms
    * Also associations that exist in the speaker's memory.
    * Slips of the tongue, jokes, dreams, are like positive entities, words function like objects.
* Signifiers are never pure signifiers, they are ridden from within with unexpected surpluses which ruin the logic of their pure differentiality.
    * They are separated from the signified, no inherent connection leading from the signifier to its meaning.
        * If this was all, the structure would be complete, without subject.
    * Signifying chain constantly produces unexpected effects of meaning, surplus meaning that stains the signifiers from within.
        * This is the locus of the subject of the unconscious.
* The signifier enters the signified and takes a place in reality, in the form of this surplus which creates and complicates the signifying relations, twisting and "driving" their logic.
    * Minus one/plus enjoyment is the structural topology where the subject of the unconscious dwells.

## JE TE M'ATHEME... MOI NON PLUS

Sophistry:
* Badiou: antiphilosopher par excellence, embraces a playful gliding on the surface of language and sense, exposing and enjoying its contradictions and paradoxes.
    * Sophist as alter ego of a true philosopher, the Other of philosophy.
    * Must be eliminated, left behind.
* Cassin: sophist has irreducible and indispensable core of philosophy, we cannot eliminate it from philosophy without losing philosophy itself.
    * Sophistry is a genuine philosophy.

Badiou and Cassin release book: Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel
* Cassin: psychoanalytic intervention should not be imperative, it has to be *equivocal*. It is not made to be understood; it is made in oder to make waves.
* Badiou: formalization is our goal, our ideal.
    * Absolute* univocity*.
    * Idea of an integral transmission without rest.
    * At the level of the matheme there is no equivocity

Lacan rejects the imperative nature of interpretation in favor of equivocity.
* Criticizes a kind of practice which brings theory into play at the wrong point or in the wrong way.
* One should not be using words that make sense only for the analyst.
* Replaced the word "word" by the word "signifer"; it lends itself to equivocity, to several possible meanings.

"I borrow my interventions from the analyst".
* Hegel: philosophical proceeding which concerns itself only with aims and results, is already beyond the thing, is not involved with it. This kind of knowing is preoccupied with itself.
* Only the analysand (unconscious) can produce the "right word." The analyst should be able to recognize it.

Equivocity itself can function directly as a formula.
* "Before it starts" joke: the punchline evokes and uses multiplicity in order to efficiently pin down and transmit a singular point (or impasse).


The symptom is a subjective solution to some contradiction or impasse. The work of analysis is forcing out the contradiction "solved" by the symptom, relating the symptom to the singular contradiction of which it is a solution.
* Psychoanalysis solves its solution, bores a hole where the symptom has built a dense net of significations. 
* Subject needs to "reconstruct" herself as part of this contradiction, as directly implied in it.
* The right (equivocal) word "bores a hole" because it repeats/names the enjoyment that holds different meanings together in a symptomatic way.

Univocity is a characteristic of the symbols of animal language.
* Equivocity is the inherent condition of formalization, which is the formalization of the impasse/ "hole" through which meanings exist as bound together in a given configuration.
* Key (right word) works in dissociating structure, unlocks the form of unconscious itself.
* Formalization concerns the point of entanglement of speech (as sustaining the dimension of truth) with the Real.

Badiou: Lacan is wrong in thinking that we cannot speak about the Real and that there is no truth about the real.
* But, Lacan: we cannot speak about the Real because speech is too close to it, because it can never fully escape the Real, but holds onto it.
    * The Real is the inherent contradiction of speech.
* Paradox indicates that language cannot be neatly separated from the Real (the impossibility of saying it all).
* The place/position of truth is the point where speech "slips," "lapses" int the Real that it tries to articulate.

A matheme is the formalization of the impasse of formalization.
* The structure that attempts to articulate the Real is determined in its foundation by the Real it attempts to formulate.


Lacan tries to verbalize formulations - tying knots and throwing them at the audience.
* Similar to Beckett (to bore holes in language).
    * Equivocity and formulization are inseparable, Beckett and Lacan both use puns as "formulas".

Position of truth: taking one's place in the contradiction.
* Analysis: contradiction does not simply disappear but the way it functions in the discourse structuring our reality changes radically. This happens as a result of our fully and actively engaging in the contradiction, taking our place in it.
