# Introduction
“For the moment, I am not fucking, I am talking to you. Well! I can have exactly the same satisfaction as if I were fucking.”
- Sublimation is satisfaction of the drive, without repression.
- Normally, we think of sublimations as substitute satisfactions for a missing sexual satisfaction.
- Lacan: the activity is different, yet the satisfaction is exactly the same.
	- The satisfaction in talking is itself “sexual”.
- The satisfaction in talking contains a key to sexual satisfaction, or a key to sexuality and its inherent contradiction.

Philosophy was eager to abandon notions such as the subject, object, truth, real, as belonging to its own metaphysical past, Lacan taught that these notions themselves are not problematic. The problematic is the disavowal or effacement of the inherent contradiction (antagonism) they all imply.

Lacan’s divide: psychoanalysis as a recognized therapeutic practice, confined to its field, and Lacan’s intellectual extravagances which were all over the place (philosophy, science etc.)

“Intellectualization” accusation: Lacan: “the unconscious thinks.”

Both philosophy and psychoanalysis recently has been avoiding an encounter with each other.

Sex is a concept that formulates a persisting contradiction of reality, this contradiction is involved in the very structuring of contradicting elements.
- Sex is of ontological relevance, not as an ultimate reality, but as an inherent twist of reality.

Althusser: Marx and psychoanalysis are situated within the conflict that they theorize. They are part of the reality that they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic. 
- Scientific objectivity is not a supposed neutrality, which is a dissimulation (perpetuation) of a given antagonism.
- In social conflict, “neutral” position is that of the ruling class, because it has achieved the status of the dominant ideology, strikes us as self-evident.
	- Objectivity is capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
- One cannot see everything from everywhere, some positions dissimulate the conflict, some reveal it.

# 1 It's getting strange here
## DID SOMEBODY SAY SEX?

Freud: The Secret Passion (1962); Freud presents his theory of infantile sexuality, protest and shock ensues.
- We think that this because of Victorian morals and that now we know sexuality can be openly talked about. No, Shalev and Yerushalmi (2009) study: psychoanalytic psychotherapists confuse sexuality and romantic relationships, some cannot listen to talk about sex comfortably.
- Sexuality as defence against deeper issues about intimacy and self-identity

Systematic reduction of the notion of sexuality to “sexual practices” as constituting “sexual intercourse” and surrounded by obligatory sexual innuendo (sexual meanings).

For Freud, sexuality was the “deeper and more difficult issue” behind different sexual practices and meanings- inherently problematic, disruptive, rather than constructive of identities.
Always problematic and ontologically uncertain.
The sexual (constitutively deviational partial drives) is not the ultimate horizon of the “human” animal, or the anchor point of irreducible humanity, it is the operator of the inhuman, of dehumanization.
The sexual is that which makes us subjects, opens the perspective of the universal in psychoanalysis.

Contemporary psychotherapeutic take on sexuality:
1. Diverging from the Freudian notion of sexuality, one reduces it to a description of empirical features related to certain kinds of practice.
2. One dismissively discovers that sexuality is exactly what one has reduced it to; an overrated epiphenomenon.
There is no room left for psychoanalysis because psychoanalysis sees the impossibility of full sexual satisfaction as a constitutive and integral part of unconscious sexuality as such.

Sexual meaning is there to mask the reality of a more fundamental negativity at work in sexuality, to put up a screen that derives its efficacy from to the fact that it is itself a means of satisfaction -satisfaction through meaning, satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. 
The task of psychoanalysis is to deactivate this satisfaction, to restore sex in its dimension of the Real.

## WHERE DO ADULTS COME FROM?

Paradoxical status of infantile sexuality:
1. It exists
2. It exists in the absence of both biological and symbolic frameworks for its existence.
- Sensitivity of infantile sexuality is due to the proximity of it and adult sexuality. The “maturity” of sexual organs dramatically fails to make these organs function as exclusive sites of sexuality, or to produce a solid basis for clearly understanding and making sense of our sexuality.

[[Laplance]]: drive sexuality (le sexual) vs instinctual sexuality (le sexuel)
Le sexual: related to partial drives and their satisfaction, not innate, not object-based, not procreative.
Le sexuel: hormonally based, more or less preprogrammed. Arrives after puberty, after drive or infantile sexuality.
What is acquired through the drives precedes what is innate and instinctual.

Freud: “genital sexual organization” is far from being primordial.
- Involves unification of compound sexual drive.
- Always a forced and artificial unification
- Never fully achieved or accomplished
- “Normal” human sexuality is a paradoxical, artificial naturalization of the originally denatured drives.
- Human sexuality is “sexual” insofar as the unification at stake never really works, but allows for different partial drives to continue their circular, self-perpetuating activity.

Problems with this narrative:
- It advances from the supposedly original, free, and chaotic multiplicity of the drive to a forced sexual unification.
- It puts the “humanly” sexual of sexuality on the side of the drives as opposed to reproductive sexuality.
- It missed the point of encounter between enjoyment involved in the drives and sexuality
- According to this narrative, adult sexuality practices are also in infantile sexuality, indicates the existence of some kind of continuity.
- Leaves out the unconscious (ontological negativity).
- According to this narrative, infantile enjoyment is sexual because it is contaminated with “enigmatic signifiers”, unconscious and sexually charged messages of adults.
- Unconscious makes a pleasure “sexual”.
- What sexualizes infantile pleasure is the encounter with the unconscious of adults, a minus (something that comes only as missing from its place in the Other).

The unconscious starts with the repression as the signifying form pertaining to discursivity as such.
- Unconscious comes to us from the outside.
- Freud: actual repression is already based on repression; repression is constitutively redoubled.
- Lacan links it to the signifying structure and to a “necessary fall of the first signifier”, which coincides with the constitution of the subject: “the subject is constituted around the Urverdrangung.”

There is something about sexuality that appears only as repressed, something that registers in reality only in the form of repression (not as something that is, then repressed)

Much too simple opposition between the “subversive” chaotic multiplicity of the drives and “normative sexuality”. (progressive psychoanalytic explanation)
## CHRISTIANITY AND POLYMORPHOUS PERVERSITY

Common perception: cultural normativity promotes heterosexual intercourse and bans/represses drive sexuality (seen as perverse, asocial)
- Really? Christianity:
	- Christ is valued for his body, the body is the means by which communion in his presence is incorporation -oral drive. Its content has nothing to do with copulation.
	- Everything is exhibition of the body evoking jouissance without copulation.
	- There is nothing asocial in partial drives: they are the very stuff of communion.
	- Something disruptive at stake in “copulation”.
	- Christianity doesn’t need copulation. Even the “purest” sort of procreative sexual copulation is connected with sin.
		- St Augustine: sexuality is not the original sin (disobedience when eating from the tree of knowledge), it is the punishment for it, locus of its perpetuation. It is problematic enough to be seen as a punishment, a curse.
	- Procreative intercourse is banned from the religious imaginary
	- Stories of martyrdom are full of partial objects (Saint Agatha’s cut-off breasts).
	- In its libidinal aspect the Christian religion massively relies on what belongs to the register of “infantile sexuality”.
	- Pure enjoyment, “enjoyment for the sake of enjoyment,” is not banned. What is banned, or repressed, is its link to sexuality.
- Strong social pressure put on “natural sexuality” to function as the norm is there to hide an abyssal negativity of natural sexuality itself, more than to keep the supposedly disruptive partial drives away.
	- Nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our Other) in the first place. Culture is not something that denatures, splits natural sexuality; it is being generated at the very locus where something in nature (as sexual nature) is lacking.

Claim: there is no sexual instinct, no knowledge inherent to sexuality which would be able to reliably guide it.
- In the usual perspective; this lack of sexual instinct is perceived as something specifically human, induced by the human constitution (and the following culture).
	- Humanity as a deviation from Nature, from the Animal.
- Another perspective; humanity as that point of Nature where its lack of “knowledge” (of sexual law) acquires a singular epistemic form, the point of a specific articulation of Nature’s own inherent negativity.
	- What is the difference between the human animal and other (sexual) animals?
		- Human sexuality is the point at which the impossibility (ontological negativity) pertaining to the sexual relation appears as such, “registers” in reality as its part. It registers in the singular form of the unconscious.
		- Fundamental lack of knowledge, difference between two ways of not knowing:
			- Animals do not know that they do not know.
			- The human animal knows that it doesn’t know.
				- They are not simply not conscious of it, they are unconscious of it.
				- It involves not knowing that we know… that we don’t know.
					- Lacan: unconscious knowledge is a knowledge that does not know itself.
					- Unconscious is the form of existence of an ontological negativity pertaining to sexuality (“there is no sexual relation”).

What is being banned in Christianity?
- The ontological negativity of sexuation and sexuality as such.
- What is being banned is not the Signifier of the sexual (or its Image), but the (unconscious) knowledge of the nonexistence of such a Signifier.

What did Adam and Eve get to know when they ate from the tree of knowledge?
- Signifying structure of knowledge as such, the gap of the unconscious.
- The gap distinguishes knowledge from information or data.
- They were transmitted the gap of the Urverdrangung as constitutive of knowledge.
- When they ate, the result was an affect; they found the sight of their naked bodies shameful.
	- Shame is ontological: appears at the place of the lacking signifier (-1), because there is no signifier appears there.

Bible refers to sexual intercourse as “knowing the other”.
- “Knowing the other in the biblical sense” is to engage with the point in the Other where knowledge is lacking.
	- Sight of naked bodies is “shameful” because they fail to convey the sexual relation.
	- Sexuality on the level of the imaginary; we can only see bodies enjoying parts of other bodies.

The norm emerges at the point of this lack in representation; the norm takes the place of the image that “one has never seen”, that of a body completely wrapping itself around the Other’s body.
- The fantasy is sustained by the imposition of the norm, sustaining the norm in turn: the fantasy of sexual relation.

Non-relation is not the absence of relation, it is a real, the Real.
- The sexual relation of fantasy does not exist, the reality of partial drives and fleeting pleasures is not the ultimate raw reality, all there is.
- The lack of sexual relation is real in the sense that as lack of negativity, it is built into what is there, determining its logic and structure in an important way.
	- False opposition between full positivity of the drives and the negativity at work in sexuality.
- The fantasy and imperative of the relation comes from within the very structuring of the drives.


# 2 ... and even stranger out there
## THE QUANDARY OF THE RELATION

Politics refers to what can be articulated around some fundamental social antagonism.

Politics and psychoanalysis:

* One tends to leave sexuality out
* Or, Western ideology; combination of moral liberalism and political conservatism
* Both mistaken:
    * First dismisses sexuality as *something* that has a secondary, regional relevance.
    * Second dismisses politics as *something* that is necessarily pathological.
    * "Something", the Real is precisely not being, but its inherent impasse.

Lacanian concept of the sexual does not provide the best description of a certain reality, since it does not have to do with sexual content. But, beyond sexual content and practices, the sexual is not a pure form, it refers to the absence of this form, as that which curves and defines the space of the sexual.

Sex vs unicorns:

* Unicorn, we have the idea, but it is nowhere to be found empirically.
* Sex, we recognize empirically, but we don't have the Idea of sex (Plato), its essence.
    * Presenting sex as low and "dirty" is already a response to a fundamental scandal - that we don't know what it is.
    * There is sex only in something that does not work.
    * Culture is not simply a mask/veil of the sexual, it is the mask for something in the sexual which "is not".
        * Freud: civilization is sexually driven; it is driven by that which is not.

That which is not in the sexual is the relation: *there is no sexual relation*.

* We conclude hastily as: the ontologically stated non-relation is seen as the obstacle to the formation of any "successful" concrete, empirical relationship.
* Lacan's point: it is only the inexistence of the relation that opens up the space for relationships and ties as we know them.
    * Non-relation is the inherent logic of the relationships that are possible and existing.
    * Biased by its constitutive negativity, this structure is always more or less than the sum of its elements.
    * The impossible substance of enjoyment = object a, objective counterpart of the non-relation (non-relation as object).
    * Object-disoriented ontology, ontology as "disoriented" by the object a.

"The sexual is political", as in, a true emancipatory politics can be thought only on the ground of an "object-disoriented ontology": ontology that does not purse being qua being, but but the crack (the Real, the antagonism) that haunts being from within.
## THE ANTI-SEXUS

Andrei Platonov's text. In its introduction, Aaron Schuster:

* Is sexuality to be liberated, or is humanity liberated from sexuality? Is sexuality the object of or the obstacle to emancipation?

Emancipation is most often conceived in terms of freeing ourselves from the social non-relation, Lacan says the opposite: the aim to abolish the non-relation is the trademark of all social repression.
* Oppressive societies: if there is to be a relation, women need to be such and such.
	* Oppressive society forces the impossible.
* Psychoanalysis: Woman does not exist.

Contemporary "secular" form of social order and domination abandoned the idea of a harmonious totality to the advantage of the idea of a non-totalizable multiplicity of singularities forming a "democratic" network.

Lacan: there is no neutrality of social being, social being is fundamentally biased.
* Discursive space is biased by the missing element of the relation.
* Neutral social being represses consequential negativity. It is another form of the narrative of the relation, it is accompanied by the idea of some kind of self-regulation.
    * E.g. "the invisible hand of the market"

Non-relation is a priory, appears with every empirical relation as inherent to its structure.
* Choice is not between relation and non-relation, it is between different kinds of relations that are being formed in the discursive space curved by the non-relation.

Anti-Sexus:

* Presupposition:
    * Sexuality is problematic because it involves the unpredictable Other. At the same time, sex stands in the way of good social relations.
        * The Anti-Sexus can distillate the pure essence of sex, and provide "Other-free" enjoyment, at the same time create real, lasting bonds (pure spiritual friendship).
* Two aims:
    * To extract sex from the Other
        * Pure substance of sex
    * To exempt the Other from sex
        * Sexless Other
* The crucial obstacle to global human emancipation is humanity itself, to solve it, Anti-Sexus proposes to canalize the disruptive element.
    * The disruptive element is not an element
    * Anti-Sexus only provides to remove the Other from sex, not a method to remove sex from the Other.
        * The Other is sexless if he or she is being masturbated most of the time.

"To make oneself masturbated"- Lacan's conceptualization of the drive.

* Instead of active or passive, something active in the heart of passivity, and vice versa.
    * E.g. scopic drive, to make oneself seen.
* The formula of the nonexistent "sexual drive".

The Other and enjoyment like matryoshka:

* Enjoyment is "in" the Other, but when we look "in" the enjoyment, there is also the Other "in" it.
* Also the non-relation between the subject and the Other.
    * If enjoyment is what disturbs this relation, it does so by implicating, placing them one in the other, not by coming between them (holding them apart).
* All enjoyment already presupposes the Other, regardless of whether we "get it" with the help of the "real other" (another person) or not.
* There is no enjoyment without the Other, because all enjoyment originates at the place of the Other (as the locus of the signifiers).
    * Innermost enjoyment can only occur at that "extimate" place.
    * Radical heterogeneity, antagonism between the signifier and enjoyment is not due to their heterogeneous origins, but to the fact that they originate at the same place.
    * The Other is both the locus of the signifier and the locus of enjoyment.

Relation between enjoyment and sexuality exposes the non-relation at the very heart of every relation.
## THE INVISIBLE 'HANDJOB' OF THE MARKET

The non-relation is at work in all forms of social bond.

* In the field of love, the relation stops not being written from time to time.
* Social relations of power- domination, exploitation, discrimination- are forms of exploitation of the non-relation.

Abolishing the non-relation: emancipatory projects of 'new order', attempting to force the non-relation out of the social equation.

Vs.

Exploitation of the non-relation: 'narratives of the Relation', present a given form of social antagonism as the ultimate Relation, supposedly protecting us from the utter Chaos of the non-relation.

* Social injustice → higher Justice
* 
* Actual, concrete exploitation is based on this appropriation of "privatization of the negative."
* E.g. capitalism:
    * Starts off with two revolutionary ideas: "the economic Relation does not exist" and "the non-relation could be very profitable".
    * The non-relation is profitable, it is the ultimate source of growth and profit.
    * Adam Smith:
        * Non-relation is a fundamental state
        * Individuals are driven by egotistic drives and the pursuit of self-interest, by ruthlessly pursuing one's own interest, one promotes the good of society as a whole much more efficiently that when one sets off to promote it directly.
            * What we find at the very core of the most selfish individual enjoyment is actually the Other.
        * Mistake: what we find at the core of this Other is a most "masturbatory self-enjoyment. Not only individuals never do what we think we are doing, the Other and its invisible hand also do not do only what they think they are doing.
            * The invisible hand of the market is always already the invisible handjob of the market, putting most of the wealth decidedly out of common reach.
    * Everybody is living better than two centuries ago, yet the price of this modern economic higher Relation is that the differences between the rich and poor are exponentially greater, fed by the non-relation in its "higher" form.
    * In order for the non-relation to be profitable, it has to be built into the very mode of production.
        * Marx: money → capital. What makes the products (labor power) also appears with them on the market as one of the products, objects for sale.
        * Capitalism exploits the point of negativity of the social order, capitalists are not "stealing" from the workers, they are employing them to make the negativity/entropy of the system work for them. They are making themselves enriched.
    * Labor power as commodity is the point that marks the constitutive negativity, gap, of this system: the point where one thing immediately falls into other (use value → source of value).
        * Labor power has no use value, it leaps over to the source of value.
        * "The Worker does not exist." What exists is the person whose work is sold and bought.
            * A Worker that existed would actually be a slave.
            * The proletariat is not simply one of the social classes, it names the point of the concrete constitutive negativity in capitalism.
                * Not the sum of all workers, the concept names the symptomatic point of this system, its disavowed and exploited negativity.


# 3 Contradictions that matter
## SEX OR GENDER

Psychoanalysis relates sexuality to an epistemological difficulty, with immanent ontological relevance. What is sexuality?

* The problematic territory of being that seems to throw us out of joint, disorient us, and make us indulge in things characteristic of human society (politics, art, science, love, religion...)
* The reason why sexuality is closely related to the unconscious and to the mechanisms of repression is not its moral controversy, but_ its paradoxical ontological status_, manifesting itself as an _epistemological limit_.
    * Moral issues originate from its ontological problem.
* Introduces us to the lack of the last instance.

Sexuality as an immediate political problem.
* Feminism: always been political movement.
    * Depends on positing sexual difference as a political problem, and hence on situating it in the context of social antagonism and of emancipatory struggle.
    * Doesn't try to affirm some other, female identity, starts from the fact that "women" were nonexistent in a political sense.
        * Nonexistence functioned as a homogeneity of the political space, feminism transformed it into a split which concerns all.
        * Split is not independently existing ontological divide (men vs women) but something that constitutes sexual difference as difference.
            * Traditional division between masculine and feminine worlds does not see sexual difference as difference. Unity is not threatened by this "difference".
    * Female identity sustains exclusion.
        * Emancipatory politics begins with "loss of identity", which is good.
    * Capacity to inscribe the problem of division and difference into the world the homogeneity of which is based on exclusion.
        * Exclusion of the split as such, erasing of a social antagonism.
* Sexual difference is not that between different identities, but as an ontological impossibility (implied in sexuality) which opens up the space of the social (where identities are also generated).
    * Ontologically determinative negativity, lost with its replacement with "gender differences."
        * Joan Copjec: gender theory removed the sex from sex: the sex of sexual difference dropped out when this term was replaced by gender.

Sex as the subject of ontological inquiry.

* Primitive science as a sexual technique; ontologies used to rely on sexual difference (ying-yang, water-fire etc.)
    * Sexual difference anchored in essentialism.
    * Traditional ontology was a machine for producing "masculine" and "feminine" essences, or, for grounding these essences in being.
* Modern science and philosophy "desexualized" reality, abandoned sexual difference as the organizing principle of reality.
    * Break with ontology tout court: modern science is not ontology, does not pretend to make ontological claims, _it also does not recognize that it is nevertheless making them._
    * Kant, if one can have no knowledge about things in themselves, the classical ontological of being qua being seems to lose its ground.
* Lacan and Freud on the same line with modern science; desexualization.
    * Lacan: psychoanalysis proceeds from the same status as Science itself. It implies no recognition of any substance on which it claims to operate, even that of sexuality.
    * The sexual in psychoanalysis is different form the sense-making combinatory game, it is something that disrupts this game and makes it impossible.
    * Psychoanalysis is coextensive with desexualization of reality, and absolutely uncompromising when it comes to the sexual as the irreducible Real (not substance).
        * Reduction of sex and the sexual to the point of ontological inconsistency, which, as such, is irreducible.

Non-relationship between psychoanalysis and ontology.
* "Gender is social construct" is deadlocked, remains in the dichotomy nature/culture.
* Butler: gender is performative; actions create the essences that they express. Nothing preexists.
    * Dynamics of repetition opens up the only margin of freedom.
    * Performativity is different from linguistics in terms of time. Socio-symbolic constructs, through repetition, become nature.
        * Dialectics of nature and culture → internal dialectics of culture. Culture both produces and regulates "nature".
    * Performativity is a kind of onto-logy of the discursive, responsible for both the* logos* and the *being* of things.
* Lacanian psychoanalysis seems compatible with performativity but is irreducibly different:
    * Not only does it have to take into account the real, Lacan takes the signifying order as the locus of a fundamental *split*.
    * The signifying order creates its own space, but something else gets added to it; something parasitic on performative productivity, produced with it and "on top of" it.
        * Collateral for the symbolic
        * The signifier also "produces" the dimension of the Real, related to the points of structural impossibility/contradiction of symbolic reality itself.
        * This is the dimension that sustains the "vital" phenomena (libido or jouissance, drive, sexualized body) in their out-of-jointness with the symbolic.
        * Responsible for the fact that the field of the Other is never neutral (or structured by pure differentiality), but conflictual, asymmetrical, "not-all", ridden with a fundamental antagonism.
            * Antagonism as such is not *between* different elements, it is the structuring principle of the elements involved in it.
        * The signifying structure is coextensive with a gap.
        * Lacan: implication of discursivity and gap = signifier of the lack in the other.
            * The signifying order emerges as already lacking one signifier, it appears with the lack of a signifier "built into it" (*lack of "binary signifier"*)
            * The signifying order begins not with One or multiplicity. It begins with a "minus one".
        * In the place of the gap, *surplus-enjoymen*t appears and stains the signifying structure: it is the heterogeneous element.
        * Enjoyment marks (curves) the signifying order by sticking to a certain set of signifiers that relate in some way to the lack of the signifier.
        * The way enjoyment relates to the signifying order passes through the negativity (minus one).
            * This negativity is the Real of the junction between the missing signifier and enjoyment;* this configuration is sexuality*.
    * Sexuality is not a being that exists beyond the symbolic: it exists as the contradiction of the symbolic space that appears because of the constitutively missing signifier and enjoyment that appears at its place.
    * Human sexuality is the placeholder of the missing signifier. It is a mess that compensates for the sexual relation as impossible (to be written).
        * Messiness is result of the attempt to invent a logic at the very point of the impasse of such logic.
    * *Formulas of sexuation *restate the issue of sexuality and "sexual relations" as a logical problem (problem of the signifying logic) out of which it springs.
    * Lacan: being vs the Real.
        * The Real is not a being but it is its deadlock.
        * All being is symbolic; being in the Other.
        * There is only being in the symbolic, except that there is the Real, which exists only as the inherent contradiction of symbolic being.
    * Copjec: sex is the impossibility of completing meaning, not (Butler:) a meaning that is incomplete. Language is structurally incomplete, not sex. 
* In order to speak of being qua being, one has to amputate, eradicate a negativity (contradiction as such). Being qua being is not elementary given, it is already a result which presupposes a previous step of losing the Real.
* Concept of the Real is lost when sex → gender.
    * Genders are said to *be*, or to exist.

## SEXUAL DIVISION, A PROBLEM IN ONTOLOGY

What is the relationship between sexual difference and sexuality?

* Freud: the sexual drive is independent of its object; its origin is not due to its object's attractions.
    * The exclusive sexual interest felt by men for women is also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a self-evident fact based upon an attraction that is ultimately of a chemical nature.
    * Original nonexistence of any germ of two sexes during preadolescence.
        * Auto-erotic activity of the erotogenic zones is the same in both sexes.
        * Libido is invariably of a masculine nature, whether it occurs in men or in women and irrespectively of whether its object is a man or a woman.
            * Masculinity and Femininity are just ideals that exist nowhere in reality.
            * If pure Masculinity and pure Femininity existed, their sexuality would be one and the same ("masculine")
    * Sexual difference does not arise from there being two sexes or two sexualities, but from the fact that there is no "second sex", and from an enigmatic indifference of the "sexual thing" (polymorphically perverse autoeroticism) that appears at the point of the "missing sex".
        * What splits into two is the very nonexistence of the one (the one which would be the Other).

Early Lacan vs late Lacan

* Early: The presence of the signifier induces irredeemable loss on the part of the human animal: once it is articulated in the signifier as "demand", need is irreversibly alienated.
    * The presence of the signifier deviates man's need: when subjected to demand, needs come back to him in an alienated form.
    * What is alienated in needs constitutes *primal repression*, as it cannot be articulated in demand.
        * Nevertheless appears in an offshoot:* desire*.
    * Phallus designates "meaning effects as a whole".
* Late: signifying order is coextensive with a lack.
    * There is no another side of the signifier (pure organic need), it has a reverse side.
    * The minus is the foundation (of the One of the signifying order).
    * Change in mythology.
        * Nature is not interrupted with the emergence of the signifier.
        * Human story begins with the emergence of the signifier, one signifier "gone missing".
            * Speech is already a response to the missing signifier, which is not (there).
            * The condition of speech is  "one-signifier-less".
    * Signifying structure emerges with-without one signifier, this "hole" has consequences and determines what gets structures around it.
    * Coffee without cream/without milk joke: the waiter's response introduces paradoxical spectral entity in the very dimension of negativity.
        * "Without" = "with the lack of"
    * Closer to Hegel  than early period of Lacan.
    * Closer to Freud than early period of Lacan.
        * Freud: the "human deviation" starts with a surplus-enjoyment, there not being a natural need pure, devoid of surplus element which splits it from within.
        * Lacan complements Freud with the theory of the lack of one signifier as the other side of the surplus-enjoyment which pertains to the satisfaction of all our needs.
    * Primal repression belongs to the signifying structure itself, it appears as "one with" the originally missing signifier, as synonymously with the structure with-without.

Sexual difference, or division, originates in this ontological deficit.

* What splits into two is the very nonexistence of the one (of the one which, if it existed, would be the radically Other). What splits in two is the very "one that lacks", the minus, the with-without.
* Formulas of sexuation are two ways in which the constitutive minus of the signifying order is inscribed in the order itself and dealt with.
    * Phallic function (*ϕ* x) marks the constitutive minus of the symbolic order.
        * Universal function, prerogative of subjectivity as such, yet there is nothing sexually neutral about its operation, it always follows the logic of this or that (sexed) position, does not exist as a neutral foundation (zero level of subjectivity).
    * There is no subjectivity beyond (or simply outside) the sexual division.
        * Sexual difference is not a secondary distinction of subjectivity, or simply culturally constructed.
* Like Kant's antinomies of reason; difference or contradiction does not exists between the two sides or positions (as in difference between man and woman). The two positions are parallel configurations of a difference or contradiction of the signifying order itself, which they logically decline in different ways (each one producing the fundamental contradiction in its own way).
* Phallus is not a differentiating feature, it is the signifier of the difference as such.
* Sexual difference is a difference in configuring the minus marked by the phallic function as the function of castration.

Formulas of Sexuation
![[formulas-of-sexuation.png]]
* Left side is masculine side
    * Posits that there exists One that is not castrated (has access to full enjoyment, e.g. the primordial Father, the Woman)
    * The exclusion of this One is the way in which the subject emerging on this side appropriates the minus involved in the signifying order.
        * The negative reference point is constitutive, permits everything else to be constituted as such, as a whole: all x are subject to the function of castration.
        * E.g. primordial father: the exception (the "killing") of the One frames the renunciation common to all.
    * Castration: to give up what one never had, to transform the "minus one" which comes with the signifying order into something that we have renounced.
    * "Negative quantity" of the signifier, the lack of the signifier gets a signifier called *Phallus *(*ϕ*, master signifier, S1).
        * Assuming castration by relying on the phallus, assuming the lack in the Other by repressing it.
    * Subject relies on *ϕ *and establishes a relation to the Other in the guise of the small *a* on the right-hand side of the formulas.
        * The One (cut out) provides the signifying frame, the "window of fantasy", through which the other can appear as desirable (as object-cause of desire).
        * Lacan: man never deals with anything by way of a partner but object *a* inscribed on the other side of the bar.
            * E.g. *Rear Window*, fiancée is desirable only when she enters the frame of the window.
* Right side is feminine side.
    * Castration does not rely for the feminine subject on the exclusion (exception) of the non-castrated Other.
    * Castration does not allow for any exception.
    * Not all x are subject to castration. (we cannot speak of "all" women or, simply, of *the* woman)
    * Juncture of two claims:
        * Woman is the Other, in the most radical sense, in the sexual relationship.
        * There is no Other of the Other.
            * If the woman is the Other of man, man is not the Other of woman.
            * The relationship to the Other is included in the Other, it is "part" of the Other.
    * Woman thinks of the Other as part of the rule, as included in the rule.
    * Not-all: the nonexistence of the Other is itself inscribed into the Other.
        * Unconscious: not a point of self-reflective transparency, but a signifying gap constitutive of knowledge.
        * Barred Other is not simply lacking other, but the Other the inconsistency of which is inscribed in it, has a marker in it.
        * *S(Ⱥ): woman's jouissance:* enjoyment appearing at the place of the gap of the non-emergence of one signifier is that of the unconscious, not as repressed, but as the very substance of the missing signifier which, as missing, gives its form to the unconscious.
        * Limits of knowledge: one cannot know anything about the other's enjoyment, this enjoyment is not an object of knowledge because it is a place-holder for the knowledge which does not exist.
            * This enjoyment appears because there is nothing to know there.
            * _Woman's jouissance is the signifier of the lack of knowledge (in the Other); marks the point where the Other does not know._
            * "Feminine jouissance" is not an obstacle to the sexual relation, but a symptom of its nonexistence.
    * Woman also has relation with the signifier of castration *ϕ: *since the woman has a relationship with *S(Ⱥ)*, she is redoubled, not-whole, since she can also have a relation with *ϕ.*
        * Relation with the signifier *ϕ *is that on which existence is founded for any speaking being.
        * Relation with *S(Ⱥ) *puts us on the path of "ex-sistence".
        * Woman is fully in the phallic function, but there is something else which comes with the position of being the Other in the sexual relation, this supplement (relation with *S(Ⱥ)*) makes her relation with *ϕ *different than in the case of a man.
            * Woman cannot rely on a constitutive exception, but relies on a constitutive *deception*.
            * Riviere: femininity as such is nothing but the susceptibility to wear femininity as a mask (to wear castration as a mask). There is no "true femininity" as opposed to femininity as masquerade.
            * The essence of femininity is to pretend to be a woman.
        * Castration is not repressed, neither is it assumed as something empirical.
    * The phallic function is not masculine: what we perceive as "masculinity" and "femininity" are different ways of its deployment. "Putting it on" suggests femininity.
    * "Feminine anxiety": anxiety pertaining to femininity as essentially a masquerade.
        * Not a dread of being punished for stealing the father's property, but more fundamentally, the anxiety of literally *being nothing*.
        * The subject hinges on the mask, under the mask, there is nothing but sheer ontological anxiety.
        * Lacan: this radical ontological anxiety is the prerogative of subjectivity as such. Subject as such is feminine.
            * Man believes that he is (exists), "male anxiety" usually stops at castration anxiety. Man is the subject who believes he is man. Masculinity is a question of belief based on, and sustained by, the repression of castration.
* Masculinity is a matter of belief, femininity is a matter of pretense.
* Subjects are not constructed by language; they are produced as a response to its inherent limit, and the unexpected plus appearing at this limit.

Lacan criticizes structural linguistics.
* Saussure: S/s (signifier over signified).
* Emphasis on pure differentiality. Saussure: in language there are only differences without positive terms, signifiers "make sense", produce meaning, only as parts of differential networks of places, binary oppositions, etc.
* Emphasis on the arbitrariness of the sign: the signifying chain is separated from the signified, which is what the par in the Saussurean algorithm indicates.
    * Lacan: algorithm sustains the illusion that the signifier serves the function of representing the signified, it has to justify its existence in terms of some signification.

![[2020-12-27_173829.png]]
Erroneous conception: the signifier "tree" serves to represent some signification.
* It is not enough to assert that there is no connection between the two levels (would remain the enigmatic sign of a total mystery)
* Lacan: the signifier "enters the signified", the bar between them does not exactly prevent that.
    * With-without: the signifier does not represent a signified, nor is it simply "an enigmatic sign of a total mystery", it is with-without the signified (as the binary signifier).
    * The lack of the relation (bar between the two levels) is* inherent to* the signifier (and the signifying order) as such.
        * Not incapacity of the signifier, but language's inherent minus and contradiction.
    * A signifier is linked to another by the negativity of with-without: this is the gap inherent to the signifying order where Lacan situates the subject of the unconscious.
        * Binding negativity: "a signifier represents the subject for another signifier".
        * With-out is the formula of the unconscious, of the form of the unconscious.
* Saussure: in language, everything is based on relations, pure relational differentiality.
    * Lacan: pure relational differentiality can only be based on a non-relation, on *a different kind of difference.*
        * The one (of the binary relation) has to be missing.

The real of sexual division is linked to the point of the "missing one".
![[2020-12-27_175917.png]]
* We have differentiality (two different signifiers), but there is nothing different in the realities to which they refer.
    * Not one reality, reality as split.
* Example of the presuppositions of the functioning of the signifier.
    * "Ladies and gentlemen" as example of the constitutive gap and contradiction at the core of the signifying logic.
* Train window, brother - sister example: they cannot agree where they are.
    * Sexual difference is the consequence of the the fact that something is lacking in the signifying order (at the same time, there is something excessive in it- surplus-enjoyment).
    * Difference has no ground: there is no "two homelands", their homeland is one and the same: this oneness and sameness is the oneness and sameness of pure difference.
* Heteronomy is not that between Ladies and Gentlemen, but between language as a system of differences and the object-like surplus (a) appearing at the place of the constitutive minus of this system, spoiling its pure differentiality.
    * Sexual difference is difference in the configuration of this "spoiling".
* Speech in psychoanalysis: not only laws of pure differentiality;
    * Also sonorous similarities or homonyms
    * Also associations that exist in the speaker's memory.
    * Slips of the tongue, jokes, dreams, are like positive entities, words function like objects.
* Signifiers are never pure signifiers, they are ridden from within with unexpected surpluses which ruin the logic of their pure differentiality.
    * They are separated from the signified, no inherent connection leading from the signifier to its meaning.
        * If this was all, the structure would be complete, without subject.
    * Signifying chain constantly produces unexpected effects of meaning, surplus meaning that stains the signifiers from within.
        * This is the locus of the subject of the unconscious.
* The signifier enters the signified and takes a place in reality, in the form of this surplus which creates and complicates the signifying relations, twisting and "driving" their logic.
    * Minus one/plus enjoyment is the structural topology where the subject of the unconscious dwells.

## JE TE M'ATHEME... MOI NON PLUS

Sophistry:
* Badiou: antiphilosopher par excellence, embraces a playful gliding on the surface of language and sense, exposing and enjoying its contradictions and paradoxes.
    * Sophist as alter ego of a true philosopher, the Other of philosophy.
    * Must be eliminated, left behind.
* Cassin: sophist has irreducible and indispensable core of philosophy, we cannot eliminate it from philosophy without losing philosophy itself.
    * Sophistry is a genuine philosophy.

Badiou and Cassin release book: Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel
* Cassin: psychoanalytic intervention should not be imperative, it has to be *equivocal*. It is not made to be understood; it is made in oder to make waves.
* Badiou: formalization is our goal, our ideal.
    * Absolute* univocity*.
    * Idea of an integral transmission without rest.
    * At the level of the matheme there is no equivocity

Lacan rejects the imperative nature of interpretation in favor of equivocity.
* Criticizes a kind of practice which brings theory into play at the wrong point or in the wrong way.
* One should not be using words that make sense only for the analyst.
* Replaced the word "word" by the word "signifer"; it lends itself to equivocity, to several possible meanings.

"I borrow my interventions from the analyst".
* Hegel: philosophical proceeding which concerns itself only with aims and results, is already beyond the thing, is not involved with it. This kind of knowing is preoccupied with itself.
* Only the analysand (unconscious) can produce the "right word." The analyst should be able to recognize it.

Equivocity itself can function directly as a formula.
* "Before it starts" joke: the punchline evokes and uses multiplicity in order to efficiently pin down and transmit a singular point (or impasse).


The symptom is a subjective solution to some contradiction or impasse. The work of analysis is forcing out the contradiction "solved" by the symptom, relating the symptom to the singular contradiction of which it is a solution.
* Psychoanalysis solves its solution, bores a hole where the symptom has built a dense net of significations. 
* Subject needs to "reconstruct" herself as part of this contradiction, as directly implied in it.
* The right (equivocal) word "bores a hole" because it repeats/names the enjoyment that holds different meanings together in a symptomatic way.

Univocity is a characteristic of the symbols of animal language.
* Equivocity is the inherent condition of formalization, which is the formalization of the impasse/ "hole" through which meanings exist as bound together in a given configuration.
* Key (right word) works in dissociating structure, unlocks the form of unconscious itself.
* Formalization concerns the point of entanglement of speech (as sustaining the dimension of truth) with the Real.

Badiou: Lacan is wrong in thinking that we cannot speak about the Real and that there is no truth about the real.
* But, Lacan: we cannot speak about the Real because speech is too close to it, because it can never fully escape the Real, but holds onto it.
    * The Real is the inherent contradiction of speech.
* Paradox indicates that language cannot be neatly separated from the Real (the impossibility of saying it all).
* The place/position of truth is the point where speech "slips," "lapses" int the Real that it tries to articulate.

A matheme is the formalization of the impasse of formalization.
* The structure that attempts to articulate the Real is determined in its foundation by the Real it attempts to formulate.


Lacan tries to verbalize formulations - tying knots and throwing them at the audience.
* Similar to Beckett (to bore holes in language).
    * Equivocity and formulization are inseparable, Beckett and Lacan both use puns as "formulas".

Position of truth: taking one's place in the contradiction.
* Analysis: contradiction does not simply disappear but the way it functions in the discourse structuring our reality changes radically. This happens as a result of our fully and actively engaging in the contradiction, taking our place in it.

# 4 Object Disoriented Ontology
## REALISM IN PSYCHOANALYSIS

Meillassoux (*Apres la finitude*): post-Cartesian philosophy rejected the possibility for us to have any access to being outside of its correlation to thinking.
* We are never dealing with an object in itself.
* There is no subject that is not always-already in a relationship with an object.
* The relation precedes any object or subject, the relation is prior to the terms it relates.
* All contemporary philosophies are variations on philosophies of *correlation*.
* The "co" is the grammatical particle that dominates modern philosophy, its veritable "chemical formula".

Inadequacy of correlationism is revealed when it is confronted with "ancestral statements", statements produced by experimental science concerning events that occurred prior to the emergence of life and of consciousness (e.g. "the Earth was formed 4.56 billion years ago").
* It seems as if science speaks of the Real in itself, whereas in philosophy this kind of discourse is meaningless.
* Meillassoux: certain scientific statements escape its "horizon of sense", there is something wrong with philosophy. In order to ensure the continuation of metaphysics, it has sacrificed the Real in its absolute sense.

Malabou: "cerebral unconscious" instead of "libidinal unconscious", attempt to reduce the gap between the organic and the subject via finding the organic causes of the subject.

Meillassoux: reduces the gap by preserving a certain gap between being and its mathematization.
* Realism of the correlate of the universals, or, the referent. (statement is ideal, the referent is real)


"The great Outside" is a fantasy, a screen that conceals the fact that the discursive reality is itself leaking, contradictory, and entangled with the Real, as its irreducible other side.
* The great Outside is the fantasy that conceals the Real that is already right here.


Meillassoux: the joint articulation of the real and the discursive. ("speculative" realism)
* Possible mathematization of primary qualities
* The absolute necessity of the contingent

Psychoanalysis and modern science share common ground of the Real in its absolute dimension, but they have different ways of pursuing this Real.
* Galieanism: modern notion of nature according to which nature is nothing other than the empirical object of science.
    * The revolution of Galilean science consists in producing its object("nature") as its own objective correlate.
* Modern science produces its object
    * Creates new real(ity): the object of science is not "mediated" by its formulas, it is indistinguishable from them, does not exist outside them, yet _*it is real (it has real consequences or consequences in the Real).*_
        * The new Real that emerges is a Real in which _discourse has consequences_.	
    * Shift of emphasis from a discursive study of the Real to the *consequences *of discourse in the Real
    * The definition of the newly emerged reality
        * Modern science creates a new space of the Real (Real as a new dimension of "natural" space"): physics is added to nature, with nature continuing to stay where it has always been.
            * Discourse has real consequences.
        * Nature keeps standing there as the Imaginary, as something irrelevant.
    * The problem of materialism
        * True materialism can only be dialectical materialism, grounded in the notion of conflict or contradiction, of split, of the "parallax of the Real" produced in it.
        * The fundamental axiom of materialism is not "matter is all" but relates to the primacy of a cut.
    * The fact that the discourse of science creates a space in which this discourse has real consequences (e.g. moon landing) means that it can produce something that not only becomes a part of reality, but also can change it.
* Realism in science
    * Lacan: science reduced 'nature' to a letter (reduction implies cut, substitution)
        * Not representation; the letter doesn't represent nature, but replaces it with something that belongs to discourse.
    * Meillassoux: the Real as a formalizable segment of a thing remaining, in the end, in the net of discourse.
        * Scientific formula catches in its net a fragment of the thing that is in itself absolute.
            * The Real is that portion of a substance that does not slip through the net of mathematizable science, but remains caught in it.
    * Lacan: the Real is not guaranteed by the consistency of numbers, but by the "impossible", the limit of their consistency.
        * The Real indicated by the fact that not all is possible.
        * Binding the realism of consequences to the modality of the impossible: something has consequences if it cannot be anything (if it is impossible in one of its own segments).
        * The Real constitutes a hole in semblance, has no reference but the impossible at which its deductions arrive.
    * Lacan and ancestral statements
        * Naturalist dude, self-effacing gesture of God
        * Does science study only something which we have ourselves constituted as such, posited, or is this exteriority independent of us, and has it existed exactly as it is since long before us?
            * Lacan: it is independent, yet it becomes such only at the very moment of its discursive "creation". With the emergence of the pure signifier, we get a physical reality independent of ourselves.
                * Independence also gained for the time "before us".
        * Ancient rocks are objective correlates of the emergence of a break in reality as a homogeneous continuum (the break of modern science).
        * Dialectically materialist: the break implies a speculative identity of the absolute and of becoming. *Something can become absolute*.
        * The absolute is both necessary and contingent: there is no absolute without a break/cut in which it is constituted as absolute.
            * Meillassoux absolutizes contingency as the only necessity. (Logic of constitutive exception: all is contingent, except the necessity of this contingency)
            * Lacan: necessary not-all: contradiction is the point of truth of the absolute necessity: the absolute is at the same time both necessary and contingent.
* Science v psychoanalysis
    * Lacan: science has no memory, it forgets a dimension of truth that psychoanalysis seriously puts to work.
        * No memory of that out of which emerges the objective status of its enunciations.
    * Radical discontinuity at the core of every significant scientific breakthrough, establishes the absolute status of its objects; the *subject is the name of this discontinuity.*

## HUMAN ANIMAL

Human animal based on double difference:
* First, difference that differentiates one animal species from others.
    * Inclusive; humans have a properly differentiated place within the animal kingdom
* Human exception (human difference is different kind of difference), divide between ourselves as animals and ourselves as something else.
    * E.g. body/spirit, the distinction of the second term is testified to by its ability to ignore or even turn actively against the first term, which binds us to animality.
    * Animality in two ways:
        * Figure of untamed excess
            * Christianity invented autonomy of the excess and cast it as sin.
            * Image of an unrestrained, excessive enjoyment.
        * Figure of animality as lacking any (real) excess.
            * Modern figure 
            * Organic/symbolic system closed upon itself, unable to do something more than be an extension of "natural causality", not being ridden with some kind of excessive restlessness, being-toward-death (Heidegger), jouissance (Lacan).
            * E.g. Kant
                * Pathological actions are those of the "human animal".
                * Ethical subject requires not only conforming to the moral law, but also the additional, excessive "only because of the law".
                * "Human human" is on the side of the excess, including the excessiveness of the moral law itself, interrupting natural causality.
    * Nietzsche: the problem is that humans are not half animals and half something else, they are half animals, full stop. There is nothing but the animal part, even this part is not "whole", lacks something. The superstructure of humanity is generated as a disguise, as clothing for this lack, for this failure to be fully animal.
        * Humans are shameful sight as tame animals and need moral disguise.
        * Man as a being the animal part of which is lacking something, and "humanity" as the dress to cover up this lack, missing part.
            * Not a vulgar evolutionist notion of humanity as prosthesis, making up for a deficiency. Instead, inventing "humanity" on and around this void, without eliminating it or filling it out (as an artificial limb or organ would).
    * Lacan: there is no animal, zero level of humanity ("human animal") which, left to itself, would function on a kind of autopilot of survival or self-preservation.
        * The plus (what in human is more than animal) takes the place of the less (what in human is less than animal).
        * Drives (vs instincts), conceptualization of deviations at work at the zero level of organic functions.
            * Drive not completely separated from biological, organic needs, but cannot be simply reduced to them.
            * Enjoyment: independency of the drives, which combines with different things, ideas and objects, satisfaction beyond need.
* Heidegger's being-toward-death
    * Status of death: opens up the metaphysical dimension proper.
    * The space for the specific "immortality" in which human beings can eventually participate is opened up by man's unique relationship to his finitude and the possibility of death.
    * Immortality is based on the specific mode of human finitude.
* Lacan: the structural place occupied by death in Heidegger is the real of enjoyment, *jouissance*.
    * The fact that we are situated within an unsought portion of enjoyment makes different attitudes toward death possible to begin with. Death as such does not involve the possibility of a "dramatic" relationship to itself; this relationship becomes "dramatic" only when *jouissance* intervenes.
    * Enjoyment as "a disturbing relationship to one's body" refers to the fact that by contaminating the satisfaction of all the body's basic needs, enjoyment introduces in the supposed immediacy of living_ a crucial gap_, on account of which things can take a different course than what is supposed to be normal or natural.
        * Enjoyment fundamentally modifies the nature of natural need, _deviations are man's nature_. 
    * Surplus-enjoyment is not transgression.
    * Enjoyment is suspended in sleep
        * Dreamwork, smuggling enjoyment into a dream, which eventually disturbs us.
    * *Death drive - undead*, life is not declination from death. If it is, there is further declination from declination: the declination of life drom life produces the "death drive" as something undead that haunts both life and death.

With the positing of drive as that which constitutes the human exception, we lose something essential in the concept of the drive.
* **Trieb** is not "instinct" as in "animal instincts", unborn survivalist autopilot aiming at self-preservation.
    * Not (the) Animal
* **Trieb** is not something completely different, we miss the point when we make it the carrier of the human exception.
    * Not (the) Human
* Topology of the drive has two ways to understand
    * Standard reading: with humans the deviation from organic need is original, and it is this deviation as original that constitutes the human Difference, Exception.
    * Radical reading: as a being of the drive, man is the point where nature's own inherent impossibility gets articulated as such.
        * "Human difference" is what testifies to the fact that its Other (the Animal) does not exist.
        * Chiesa: early vs late Lacan in terms of "animal sexuality"
            * Early: key fits into keyhole, the Animal exists.
            * Late: the supposed animal model of perfectly bi-univocal reproductive complementarity is a side effect of the "fantasy of the soul" through which we imaginarily "observe" the animal.
        * Jouissance names something particularly human, it is a singularization of a general inconsistency at work in animal life. 
            * Where as animal sexuality is simply inconsistent, jouissance is something like a set containing this inconsistency as its only element.
        * Singling out occurs with the signifier and its logic.
        * Humans are the question mark to the very notion of the animal as a consistent entity.
            * Humans are the living proof that the Animal doesn't exist.

The speaking being is neither part of nature, nor its exception, but its Real (the point of its own impossibility, impasse).
* The "natural norm" is secondary to the "incomplete ontological constitution" of nature.
* But, the incomplete ontological constitution is not synonymous with chaos.
    * Nature is not chaotic, it is lawful, but this lawfulness is the very structuring of its own inner antagonism, contradiction, or "incompleteness".

## DEATH DRIVE I: FREUD

What Freud introduces as "death drive" (*Todestrieb*) is not what Zupancic and other Lacanians mean by it.

* Freud: "instinct" to regain the supposed original homeostatic, tensionless state.
* Zizek: death drive is the most radical tendency to maintain a state of tension, to avoid final "relaxation" in obtaining a state of full homeostasis. Death drive is the insistence of an organism on endlessly repeating the state of tension.
* There is a logic from the first to the second on the ground of sexuality.

The middle of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle":
* Death drive as primary (first instinct is that of returning to inanimate matter, all life aims for death)
* Life instincts (conservative instincts) are forces that fortify the detours from this fundamental drive.
    * Secondary formations in respect to life's primary drive, the death drive.
* Death drive names a kind of fundamental or ontological fatigue of life as such, it is the steady undercurrent of life.
* Life is accidental, there is no will anywhere that wants to live: what we see as "vital forces" are instincts constituted in the process of reiteration of the accident called life.
* There is no struggle of two wills called life forces and death forces, life is a circuitous route to death, and conservative instincts are the pavement of this route, they are indistinguishable from it.
* Instincts of self-preservation do not change life's fundamental goal, they simply introduce a* temporality* into it.
    * Mode of this temporality is *repetition*.
* Life is not the other of death, it is something that happens to the inanimate. It is interruption, a gap appearing in the inanimate.
    * Life gives a singular, separate form to an inherent gap on account of which the inanimate does not simply coincide with itself.
    * Not only that the inanimate universe is indifferent to life (materialist reproach to correlationist view of reality), we are mere perversions, strange pleasures, of the inanimate itself.
        * Life is a nightmare of the inanimate.
        * Death drive is an "objective affect" of life

The beginning of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle":
* *Pleasure principle* refers to seeking relief from tension, to the lowering of tension in an attempt to reach a homeostatic state.
    * It is a mental equivalent of what Freud later calls the fundamental tendency of all life to return to the inanimate.
        * I.e. death drive = pleasure principle
* *"Reality principle"* is like the detour of life instincts.
* (Original conception of) Death drive is not what goes on "beyond the pleasure principle".

"Sexual drives" are the only drives that break out of the circle of life and death as dominated by the pleasure principle and its fundamental aim to return to the inanimate.
* They thrive on excitement and tension, and are related to the "endless" continuation of life.
* They go out of their way to embrace some alterity, difference, the Other.
    * Pleasure needs no Other, the Other is rather disturbing to it.
* They do not go against the pleasure principle but seem to suspend it, invalidate it as a principle in the first place.
* In life more than life.

Dualistic view, opposition between Eros and Thanatos.
* *Todestriebe* is fatigue as life's fundamental and objective affect
* Sexual drives split with this logic, they are detours that make an actual difference, produce something "new", establish potential immortality (of the species).
* Dualism of the drives is actually the other side of conceiving libido as a "neutral" desexualized substance (Jung).
    * Freud: the sexual is not a principle to be properly described and circumscribed, it is the very impossibility of its own circumscription or delimitation.

The end of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle": Monism of antagonism, contradiction, or split: there are only sexual drives (all drives are sexual).
* Only sexual drives *drive* us in any meaningful sense of the word (to elsewhere than a return to an earlier homeostatic stage).
* Vs. Fatigue, "magnetism of the inanimate".
* With sexual drives, death is inherent to life, conditioning its perpetuation.
    * Death of the individual is fundamental to sex (the survival of the species means that each individual is transitory and dies).

Freud (there are only sexual drives) → Lacan (every drive is virtually a death drive): missing link between the two is that death is what lurks in the midst of sexual drives as a negative magnitude or a minus implied in them.
* Instincts (conservative drives) repeat acquired/established paths of life (detours on the path to death).
* Death drive is repetition within repetition; repetition of some (partial) satisfaction accidentally produced within conservative repetition.
    * Surplus satisfaction/excitation that occurs in the course of the functioning and satisfaction of different organic functions.
    * Surplus is internal cause of tension, the drive originating in this surplus aims at repeating this tension.
    * Instead of satisfaction producing an appeasement of a surplus excitation, satisfaction generates further excitation.
* Surplus satisfaction itself does not qualify as drive:
    * Animals also experience surplus satisfaction, yet for it to function as partial object, this satisfaction must start to function as objective embodiment of the negativity or gap involved in the signifying edifice of being.
* Death drive refers to an active split or declination within every drive, it is not one among the partial drives.
    * Split inherent to the drives as such, not the same as the split of the drive from organic functions.
    * Drive as purely disruptive pulsating negativity that gives partial surplus satisfactions their singular rhythm.
        * Like the difference between object a as marking a negativity as such and all forms of objects a, which are merely its representatives.
        * Double object a: it is a surplus satisfaction as sticking to the void, it is the void and its "crust". The real object of the drive is not simply surplus satisfaction but this negativity that "sticks" to it and is repeated by it.
        * Two splits:
            * First, split involved in the surplus satisfaction produced in the course of satisfying organic needs and function.
                * Repetition produces surplus, unexpected satisfaction, which becomes the drive of another repetition, repetition within repetition, repeating this satisfaction.
                * E.g. gluttony
                * Object-food, and there is also satisfaction as object.
            * Why can surplus satisfaction reverse the order of things?
                * The structure of the drive implies a negativity around which it circulates and which relates drive to the primal repression: inbuilt negativity -negativity transmitted with the "positive" ontological order of being.
                * If the drive wants us to repeat the surplus satisfaction, it is not because all it wants is to enjoy.
* Drive does not want us to enjoy, superego wants us to enjoy and reduces the drive to the issue of satisfaction, actively blocking access to the negativity that drives it.
    * Satisfaction (for the sake of satisfaction) is not the goal of the drive, but its means. 
    * Death drive does not only want us to enjoy, it wants only to repeat this negativity, the gap in the order of being, even if this means to enjoy.
    * Enjoyment is the means, the "aim" is the repetition of the lack of being in the very midst of being.

Sexuality proper involves a step in which the "minus", the negativity involved in sexuation and sexual reproduction gets a positive existence in partial objects as involved in the topology of the drive. 
* Partial objects are not just "satisfactions as objects", they are also figures or representatives of that negativity.
    * Sexuation → sexuality
* Common gap justifies the fact that different and polymorphous partial satisfactions are called sexual, they are "biased" by the negativity they have in common; this negativity gives them their curve.
* Double loop of the drive:
![[loop.png]]

* Death drive can eventually shift life's fundamental goal of returning to the inanimate.
    * Establishes the ways of returning to inorganic existence other than those which are immanent in the organism itself.
    * Death drive is what makes it possible for us to die differently.

## TRAUMA OUTSIDE EXPERIENCE

The question remains as to the compulsion to repeat some particularly traumatic incidents.

If one starts from the primary character of the pleasure principle (pleasure= lowering of tension), why would somebody be compelled to repeat a distinctly unpleasant experience?
* Freud: repetition appears at the place of remembering; one repeats something one cannot remember.
    * What the compulsion to repeat repeats is not some traumatic experience, but something which could never register as an experience to begin with.
    * Trauma is real, but not experienced: it is outside the horizon of experience (it is constitutive of it).
        * Laplanche: reality of the enigmatic message.
        * Only registered as an interruption of consciousness.
        * Negativity that comes as built into the conditions of experience.
            * Objectivity of trauma (independence from 'psychic life') is the condition of us having a 'psychic life' (and experiencing something as "traumatic")
* Malabou: trauma is not real, it is psychologically mediated.
    * Zupancic: mediation comes from the outside. It is not a screen separating us from the Real, but is itself partaking in ths Real.
        * Mediation is the trauma (trauma as real).
* Brassier: the separation of organic inside and inorganic outside is achieved at the price of the death of part of the primitive organism itself.
    * Death drive is the trace of the scission (primordial death): the scission cannot be bound because it remains the unbindable excess that makes binding possible.
    * Third element, death, preconditions the opposition of life and death and is presupposed by it.
    * "Life wants to return to the inanimate": life has nowhere to return to except that with the lack of which it has come to life.
* Repetition is effort to bind excess of excitation released by the traumatic breaching of defenses 'beyond the pleasure principle' when the usual mechanisms of defense (including repression) no longer work.
    * Anxiety is still a defense
* Death drive is an extension of the pleasure principle qua lowering of tension, just as repetition is?
    * Brassier: the excess of the death drive is the trace of the aboriginal trauma prior to experience, repetition (of empirically traumatic experience) is a means of awakening anxiety in order to master and "bind" the excess.

## DEATH DRIVE II: LACAN AND DELEUZE

Lacan and Deleuze reject the primacy of the pleasure principle, and the possibility of relating the death drive to a homeostatic tendency.
* Deleuze affirms the primacy of the death drive.
    * Death drive is transcendental principle, pleasure principle is only psychological part of the logic of appearing of the death drive.
* Lacan: "every drive is virtually a death drive"
    * Freud's metaphysics is from Aristotle; lowering of tension is the ethics of Aristotle.

Death drive is not some obscure will to aggression, destruction, or death.
* Deleuze: death drive linked to repetition, which is the place of original *affirmation*.
    * Affirmation: selective, not a simple opposite of negativity.
* Lacan: lamella - death drive to 'indestructible life'.

The excess of excitation does not exist independently of repetition, it exists in and through repetition itself.
* Split at the heart of repetition
* Deleuze: repetition is two-sided: it does not only repeat something (object), it also repeats difference as such (*pure difference*)
    * There is no first term which is repeated, there is no bare repetition which may be abstracted or inferred from the disguise itself.
    * Repetition is symbolic: symbols or simulacra are the letter of repetition itself.
    * Repetition as absolute beginning.
    * Reversal of Freud: we do not repeat because we repress, we repress because we repeat.
        * Two splits: the object of drive involves surplus satisfaction so it is different from the object of need. "Satisfaction as object" itself is a stand-in for a faceless negativity.
    * Pure difference is this negativity, most affirmative, productive "force".
    * *Crack (**felure**)*: fundamental, unifying negativity
        * Heredity is the crack (rift or the hole)
        * Central crack and instincts around it
        * Lacan: each partial drive is a repetition of the crack, a repetition which constitutes this object as object.

Unifying sexuality: sexuality unifies the drives as the crack around which they circulate and to which they keep returning.
* Normativity's aim is not to unify or "tame" the original heterogeneity of partial drives, but to obfuscate and exploit this founding crack and its "productivity".
* Lacan: "sexual identity" is a contradiction in terms.
    * Copulation is out of place in human reality, to which it nevertheless provides sustenance with the fantasies by which that reality is constituted.
* Deleuze: the "germen" (germ cells) is the crack, the very instance of *felure*.

Deleuze: what drives repetition is not a failure, a lack. Repetition itself is both primary motivator and motor.
* Repetition is singular negativity, and a site of affirmation. As original negativity, it is productive of what is there and what can be differentiated, compared, said to fail, etc.
* Negativity becomes most positive force.

Deleuze vs Lacan:
* Negativity → most positive force
    * Lacan: impossibility motivates repetition - non-being of what is to be repeated.
        * Enjoyment is the only "being", "substance" of that which is ontologically not, of the missing signifier.
        * Symptoms (signifying connections) are repetitions of original negativity, and its enjoyment-fueled representations related to the subject of the unconscious.
        * Fundamental negativity as a third element in relation to the unbound excess and the signifiers.
    * Deleuze: fundamental negativity is the pure movement of the unbound excess appearing with different signifying masks or "disguises"
        * Tripartite topology is collapsed into a double movement of a One.
        * Original negativity IS the positive, productive movement or force.
        * Plane of immanence: the same thing is both disguising and disguised.
        * Realized ontology: Difference: pure being qua being.
        * Topological → dynamic:
            * Topological non-coincidence of being and appearing is liquefied into Being as a pure movement of Difference.
        * There is no Real here, it is ontologized.
    * Deleuze: realism implies radical desubjectivation, Lacan: subjectivation is the instance of an irreducible Real.

New materialisms follow Deleuze and try to escape the transcendental cage, getting out of the subject.
* Lacan: if language was consistent ontological category, there would be no subject.
* Materialism as realism: exposes the brute reality, the material truth or basis of things that seem to stand on their own.
    * The reality minus the illusion which accompanies it and keeps transforming it into something quite different.
    * Sublime vs gruesome: realism is on the side of gruesome.
        * 1. the sobering effect of realist materialism points to a gap in realism itself: Reality "as such" appears as gruesome, it has to be perceived as more than it is: to be invested with subjective affect -repugnance, aversion, etc.
            * In order to get to reality, a surplus is needed (or produced), a surplus which is not reducible to reality such as it is.
        * 2. Opposition between "naked" reality and always-already subjectivized reality is false, not genuinely "materialist".
    * If reality appears with an irreducible excess "over" itself, this excess indicates a split or contradiction in this reality itself.
    * There is a reality that exists independently of the subject, the subject is precisely that which gives us access to reality independent of the subject.
    * Lacan's materialism: the subject is the objective embodiment of reality's contradiction. The subjective position is not only a concrete and singular way in which things determine me, it is also the subjectivation of a paradox.
        * The subject is situated at the juncture of the epistemological and ontological levels in the form of their joint negativity (lack of knowledge falls into a lack of being)
        * Materialism is thinking which advances as thinking of contradictions.

Deleuze vs Lacan:
* Common: what repeats itself is "*one-plus*": something plus the surplus that invests and drives it.
* Deleuze: the plus is identified as movement of absolute difference, the real of being.
    * The repetition of the One-plus, driven by the "plus", differentiates the two elements (one and plus) and throws out the One to the benefit of Being as singularity of a pure movement.
    * Repetition as inner differentiation of the Difference.
    * Difference is the only and the original being, at the same time it needs to be realized, repeated and separated from the metaphysical and dialectical encumbrance that constitutes the history of Being and of its thought.
    * Ethics replaced politics, claiming to carry out the task of politics better than politics. Deleuze: selection of difference based on repetition.
* Lacan: the production of a new signifier that puts an end to repetition.
    * The separation within the repeating entity (One-plus) is not the centrifugal-selective force of the repetition itself, it is a third term: S1, a new signifier.
        * The One that is repeated is a One-plus, bound by enjoyment.
        * Analysis produces a different, self-standing One: One as one alone.
            * This One functions to give signifying support to the rift, the crack, implied by yet invisible in the deployment of differences and repeated with them.
            * The new signifier names the difference that makes all the difference(s).
                * Does not replace the "hole", it produces it as something that can work as an emancipatory weapon.
            * Enjoyment is the means of production of the signifier that eventually kills it off: the signifier interposes itself between the signifying enjoyment and the hole/gap at the place of which the latter appears.
    * Vs. Deleuze: the surplus is not in itself the real scene of emancipation, but the means of production of that which eventually realizes this emancipation: the tectonic shift does not take place at the level of this surplus, but thanks to the newly produced signifier.
        * The placing of the subject at the level of enjoyment in talking enables the production of the new signifier from the perspective of which it is now possible to effect a separation at the heart of the One-plus involved in repetition.
        * New signifier is *event* proper and it triggers a new subjectivation.
        * By itself, drive does not work against repression. One cannot simply count on it to make the "right" selection.
        * Not a force, only a letter can disentangle what exists only in entangled form, and eventually change this form itself.

## BEING, EVENT, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES: LACAN AND BADIOU

Politics always involves a reactivation of the gap.

Connections between Lacan and Badiou:
* Lacanian Real and Badiou's Event
    * Lacan: the Real is the point of the internal impossibility of being: in order to speak of "being qua being", one has to amputate something in being that is not being.
        * The law of the discourse on being-qua-being is a consequence of an impossibility with which it occurs.
        * All being is discursive, but the discursive is non-all.
        * Impossibility that pertains to being and not only to the Event.
        * Discourse is implied in the gap.
    * Badiou: ontology prohibits the Event.
        * The prohibition of the Event is the "consequence of a law of the discourse on being-qua-being".
        * Being-qua-being is pure inconsistent multiplicity.
            * The discursive is only a presentation of this multiplicity, involving a "count-as-one".
        * Excess takes place on the level of what is already counted-for-one, on the level of presentation, as the excess of the parts of a given multiple or set over its elements.

Lacan vs Badiou: excess/surplus
* Badiou: uncountable excess of the multiple beyond itself is the real of being, the "being of Being".
    * Void of excess does not amount to a negativity, it suggests a desubstantialization of being.
* Lacan: the "wandering excess" is not the implication of the multiple, but of the One-less, of the minus-one.
    * Excess flourishes at the structural place of the minus one.
    * The wandering excess cannot be the Real of being, but is its symptom.
    * You can identify with the symptom, but not with the Real.
        * Blocks romanticism of the Real.
* Badiou reserves the proper name of void-set for being-qua-being, Lacan reserves it for the subject.
* Badiou wants to assert the rarity of the subject, which suspends its occurrence from the event, from the intervention, and from the generic paths of fidelity.
* Negativity:
    * Badiou has no strong concept of negativity at the level of being: Being deploys itself as pure excess over itself.
        * Pure being is inconsistent, but not ridden with any impossibility. Impossibility originates in its representation (prohibition of the Event).
    * Lacan: pure excess is already a result of a minus-one, the gap that appears together with discourse.
        * Subject is not only an effect of language, but of its breaking down, of its discontinuity.
        * Event is possible because of the impossibilty inherent to being.
* Enjoyment: 
    * Badiou does not connect "wandering excess" to surplus-enjoyment. For him, enjoyment is irrelevant.
    * Lacan: enjoyment is not irrelevant, it takes place at the point where something is lacking in the discursive.

Lacan: being is a shifting repetition of the impossible (gap), a repetition of that which is not.
* Para-ontology: being is collateral to its own impossibility, and not to the impossibility of the event.
    * An Event is related to the point of impossibility of being (impossibility to be qua being).
    * For Badiou, the interruption of being by an Event comes from "elsewhere".

Lacanian Event: happens when something "stops not being written".
* Disjunction of the necessary and the impossible.
    * Repetition is a conjunction of the necessary and the impossible ("it does not stop not being written")
    * Disjunction affirms being in its contingency.
    * Love encounter
* Pessimism: contingency moves to necessity where it doesn't stop being written.
    * Badiou: fidelity is needed to avoid this.
    * "New signifier" could build something on the basis of a love encounter.
* Love encounter happens to us, involves surprise: "how surprising that you are you!"
    * Rosset: passion vs real love
        * Passion is morbid craving for an unreal (derealized) object.
            * Involves enjoyment not in the object of passion, but in the passionate dieting itself.
        * Real love wonders at the coincidence of the loved (desired) object with an existing object.
            * A split, minimal difference is also involved in the real object,
            * Split ad the coincidence appear at the same time.
* New signifier would be capable of naming, sustaining, the minimal difference (contingency) on account of which the lover reminds me of himself.
    * Minimal difference keeps impossibility from becoming necessity.
    * E.g. nickname in love relationship: name that provides a signifier of the very disjunction of love object and existing object in a concrete love relationship.

Problem is not that of too many words: it is the loss of the Real, loss of the capacity of naming that can have real effects, the (dis)junction between the necessary and the real.

The turn to "real experience" diverts from the only way to touch something of the Real, which is the right word.
* Word that name something about our reality for the first time, and hence make this something an object of the world, and of thought.
* Not a correct description of a reality; it introduces a new reality
    * E.g. "class struggle"
