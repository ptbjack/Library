Oscar Wilde: "Everything is about sex except sex. Sex is about power."
* Sex is used for, and as, power.
* Power is the outcome of turning something in the other (e.g. their desire) against them.

***Perversion***: forcing the other to subjectivize herself.
* "Extracting" a subjectivation, forcing the other to become fully subject (to "decide", consciously accept)
* **Sadist** pervert wants the other to split (subjectivize) herself in response to the surplus object he makes appear for her, and to supplement her lack by that same object.
    * Complet(ed) subject, complete Other.

Power in its "purification" gets sexualized: the very proving of one's point is for him the ultimate source of enjoyment.

Certain subjectivation and exposure via desire can always be at stake in "sexual relations".
* Possible dimension of power.
* We risk to be, and sometimes are, hanged by the ropes of our own desire.

Desire is dialectical, cannot be reduced to its supposed last instance.
* We are split by our desire: if I don't want something and I say so, this "no" cannot be dismissed by pointing to the desire that perhaps nevertheless exists.
    * **Enjoyment**: I can be forced to enjoy what I don't want to enjoy.
    * This makes forcing more inexcusable.
* **Fantasy** is not subjective scenario waiting to be realized (rape fantasy). It participates in reality exactly as fantasy, fantasy as support of reality.
    * What prevents fantasy from being fulfilled is the fact that fantasy fully fulfills its role such as it is, as fantasy, as framework.
    * Being "realized" in its empirical content, it disappears, disintegrates as the frame that held our reality together.
        * Analysis does not realize the desire, makes it gradually useless as a frame for reality.
    * Fantasy of dying and my unfaithful lover being devastated by it;
        * Helps sustain the reality of my actual love life, not something that would constitute its future accomplishment.
        * Those who fantasize indeed feel guilty/responsible for what happens to them: telling the victim it's not their fault is not helpful if issues of desire and enjoyment are not tackled.
* To deny one's subjectivity ("it was a manipulation") is a strange way of "affirming" oneself.
    * Holding the other responsible for their actions should not have as its condition that I fully give up on my subjectivity (desire).
    * "Victim cannot be a subject": refugees appearing as subjects and not just as devastated victims pops up hostility.
        * In order for us to love our victims and help them, we need them to stay victims, and helpless.
        * **Parallax view** that the truth demands is to see in the same frame the other as the subject and the other as the victim.

Power that comes from being in the*** position ***to seduce--- power is all about position of power, sex enters the game on a secondary level.

**\1.** There are certain position which facilitate seduction and even automatically engender it.
* Psychoanalysis, transference almost inevitable appears during the treatment.
* Sex used for power.

**\2.** Abuse of power in forcing, blackmailing people to cooperate with our sexual desires.
* Power exists outside of sexuality, is used to get sex.
* Power used for sex.
* Sexuality as the hostage of power relations.
* Abuse:
    * MeToo risks ideological operation where it is implicitly suggested that power is problematic ONLY where it involves sexuality.
        * It is problematic because someone ENJOYS it--- enjoyment constitutes the link to sexuality.
    * Non-professional abuse (someone enjoys it), we have no means of addressing professional abuse.
        * Jullian Assange: the allegations of sexual abuse are enough to block out the enormous systemic and systematic crimes and abuses revealed by WikiLeaks.
    * Sexual abuse functions as a welcome decoy: as a stain the elimination of which whitewashes other ways in which power operates, making them look normal ("professional").
* Mainstream focus on sexuality and sexual scandals is ALSO a symptom: there are significant dimension of power that we simply don't talk about and don't have the means to talk about.
    * We talk about sex in a way that allows for the concealment of systemic causes of violence in general, including those of sexual violence.
    * For all the talk about sex and sexuality, nobody cares about IT. The talk is about power and whitewashing of power.
    * Sex is overexploited yet not taken seriously in itself.

Difference between subjective and systemic violence:
* **Subjective violence** is experienced as such against the background of a non-violent zero level.
    * As a perturbation of the "normal" state of things.
* **Objective violence** is the violence inherent to this "normal" state of things.
    * Has to be taken into account to make sense of "irrational" explosions of subjective violence.
    * Systemic violence is perceived as business as usual, when a serious revolt appears on the side of the people, the issue is recognized and its causes attributed to the subjectively corrupt usurpation of the systemic dimension of power, to its **abuse**.

Sexuality functions today as the embodiment of the very visibility/subjectivity of violence.
* "Sexual violence" has the capacity of absorbing/subjectivizing all layers of violence.
* If it is sexual, it cannot be but personal--- someone enjoying it, hence being personally corrupt.

Professionalism has been hijacked and taken in the direction of ***perversion***.
* Classical notion: not getting your personal preoccupations and views interfere with your job while taking full subjective responsibility for the objective outcome of your actions (objective responsibility).
* New notion cuts off any subjective dimension.
    * The professional is mere executor of higher forces, subjective dimension is reduced to just a possible source of trouble.
* Subjective responsibility for objective outcomes → Subjective explanation for what is objectively wrong.

Professionalization of power via elimination of enjoyment doesn't work, since there is ***impersonal enjoyment***.
* Perverts know that systemic enjoyment exists and how to put it to personal use, but that doesn't make the enjoyment simply subjective in its origin.


False alternative of progress/purification of power and embracing of enjoyment.
* Alternative between "left progressive liberals" and rise of the alt-right.
* The left ended up on the conservative side: defending the rule of law, conserving what we have, reacting by introducing more new rules, regulations that are supposed to keep the "anomalies" at bay and to prevent any abuse.
* Both sides are part of the same fundamental logic.

Conceptual shift: libidinal compound of power is never simply or immediately subjective it is generated out of the structure itself, and is symptomatic of its contradictions.
* A subject is not the cause of enjoyment, but a response to it.
* Enjoyment is not subjective but subjectivizing.
* Freud, discontent of civilization, is a response to "systemic enjoyment."
    * Complicity of culture and drives comes from political economy, psychic economy is its "extimate" prolongation.

Marx invented the symptom, surplus-value gives way to the concept of surplus-enjoyment.
* Theory of four discourses; discourse is not synonymous with language and speech, it now gets defined as a "social link".
* Capitalist economy discovered the systemic enjoyment emerging at the point of obstructive element of a social link as a possible source of profit.
* Capitalism is not a social link, it affects all social links. Two fundamental inventions:
    * 1. Countability of the surplus generated out of the contradiction
    * 2. Systemic exploitation of this contradiction as the very source of profitable productivity
    * Labor force as a commodity; what makes the products also appears with them on the market as one of the products, objects for sale.
        * Marks the constitutive negativity, gap of the system, where one thing immediately falls into another.
        * This peculiar commodity gives body to the point of contradiction and keeps **laboring the contradiction**.

The co-existence of the symbolic structure and enjoyment is not historical, belongs to the very "leaking" ontology of symbolic order.
* The "homologization" (in the form of a new way of counting) and consequent complicity between libidinal and symbolic is a historic occurrence or **"invention".**


Foucault describes shift from repression to the economy of repression (punishment → imprisonment and surveillance).
* Economy of repression is the vicious spiral and its "gain", mutually reinforced.
* Foucault: psychoanalysis participates in this economy; with sexuality and its repression psychoanalysis discovered something that could be infinitely exploited and put to use in this modern economy.
    * BUT Freud discovered sexuality as the privileged territory of symptoms, where the "perfect" economy does not work.
        * Sexuality as secondary surplus which cannot be put back to profitable use.
        * Libidinal economy comes with accumulating costs.
        * The threatening point is not resistance to being put to use but the fact of the useless surplus which gets produced while everything is put to use.
            * The more inclusive capitalist economy becomes, the more exclusion it generates.

***Absolute uselessness***; "systemic enjoyment" does not resists capitalist economy but threatens to make it explode.
* It can be bound by politics and ideas (e.g. populism)
    * Populism leaves the economy of repression intact and growing, it bounds the real and growing dissatisfaction of people in imaginary ways which can have very palpable material consequences.
* Climate change; while running out, natural resources seem to be re-entering our space from a "beyond", from the real, in the form of another kind of surplus.

Academic debates, shift from "politics" to "power":
* "Politics" can be judged right or wrong, even if there is no direct personal gain or abuse involved. Politics allows for discussion, controversy, rebellion, militancy.
* "Power" can never be wrong, it can only be abused.
    * Saying that it is always bad isn't saying much.
    * Criticism results in two divides, professionalism/abuse or benevolence/wickedness. These are all subjective and not social categories.
    * The bottom line of criticism of abuse/wickedness is that if we eliminate the abuser or cut out the corruption, everything will be well and sound again.
        * E.g. eliminating Trump, America will become great again.
