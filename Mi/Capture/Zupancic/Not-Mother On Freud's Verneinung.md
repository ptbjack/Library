The analytic work only starts with the "It IS mother".
- A crack at work in the relationship between categorical couples (inside/outside, pleasure/beyond).

Freud's essay ([[Negation (Verneinung)]]) is "birth of thinking out of the spirit of negation", quilting point between philosophy and psychoanalysis.
- A way of thinking of the singular and paradoxical negativity.

# 1. The With-Without

What is unconscious is not the object "mother" but the censorship: the unconscious sticks to the distortion itself.

"Not-mother": both terms contaminate each other.
- "Not" marks the mother with the stamp of desire
- "mother" contaminates the formal purity of the negation with "elements in traces".

Symptoms persist beyond becoming conscious of the repressed:
- The analysand can say "It is not not-mother", negate the negation, but wouldn't dissolve the symptoms.
- We cannot eliminate the structure of the gap that generates the repressed content.
	- Gap ===becomes visible through double negation as its "indivisible remainder"===: "it is not not-mother" is not the same as "it is mother.
	- Third dimension of the unconscious. Lacan: the status of the unconscious is not ontical but ethical.
		- Ontically, it is elusive. It is not an alternative reality into which we could translate the slips and symptoms of our reality.
		- We circumscribe it in a temporal structure.
	- "with without cream" is a trace of that which is not, the signifier has a spectral quality.

Freud's negation is not 
- Classical logic (duality of P or not-P): principles of (1) noncontradiction and (2) excluded third.
- Intuitionist logic where the negation obeys noncontradiction but not the excluded third.
- Paraconsistent logic where negation obeys excluded middle but not noncontradiction.

In Freud's negation, the third term is included as the very point of the ontological impossibility of the third. What is included as an entity receives the logical impossibility on which the alternative mother/not-mother is based.
- It is not that the impossible has become possible by being included (as in intuitionist logic).
- As included in reality, the impossible-real can only be a specter.

# 2. The Birth of Thinking from the Materiality of Negation

The third that remains between the fingers of negation of negation is nothing other than the constitutive portion of negativity of the inaugural affirmation itself.

The "Not" is condition of the unconscious, **Grund**.
- Constitution of reality, cut along the lines of appropriation (*Bejahung*) and "expulsion" (*AustoBung*)
	- split between in and out coincides with good and bad.
- Reality testing, loss of immediacy: pleasure is found-again-pleasure.
	- Repetition of pleasure existence of things, we refind objects to convince ourselves that it is still there.
- Twist of reality testing: the condition of the good and experiencing pleasure is in finding the object outside (in reality).
	- What has once been inside needs to be found outside.
	- The outside is subjectively mediated.

The cut between inside and outside, between affirmation and negation, produces three things: (1) affirmation (positivity), (2) negation (absence, what is not), (3) the place, locus, of their difference.
- The step from the original *Lust-Ich* to subjectivity proper is that of including the difference (gap/crack) that separates "me" from the outside. The negativity included in the subject is the very form of negation which reveals its structure of with-without. Cutting off of the future outside reality leaves a mark, which is what the subject relies upon in its constitution.

All being is *being with-without*. There is a hole in the order of being that curves its space.
- Ontology, the science of being qua being, cuts off the "with-without".

The negation of "not-mother" allows for the symptomatic formulation, inscription of mother in reality.
- The question to be asked is what is in the mother herself that enables her repression (the point of impossibility that determines her in her structural reality).

Reality testing: in relation to objects that the subject does find in reality, she can only say "this is not it" (in comparison to the presupposed fullness of primary satisfaction).
- "It is not mother" can attest to the fullness of the Mother ("Mother is", this person in my dream is nothing close to her).
- The existence of things is marked by a lack of something that forms the perspective on what is there.
	- Transcendental constitution of reality qua Freud: "speculative" subtraction of something that was never "objectively" there, yet the hole involved in its absence functions as the armature of objective reality.
- The end of analysis would be abandoning the thing in itself while preserving the gap that separates IT from the phenomenal reality, articulating this gap as a function of an immanent transcendence.
