[[Foucault]]'s concept of biopolitics fails to conceptualize the modern workings of 'power' and 'politics'.
- **Unconscious** is missing: for Freud, **unconscious sexuality**, something is constituvely unconscious about sexuality; problematic, lacking, **irreducible to any kind of truth about itself.** Unconscious refers to active *process, work of censorship, substitution, condensation etc.*. This work is not simply performed in relation to sexuality (desire), it is intrinsic to its deadlocks.
- Foucault assimilates Freudian repression and *Verdrangung* into general notion of 'repression' (as in 'repressive hypothesis')
	- unconscious -- secret to be exploited.
- The perception according to which psychoanalysis holds sexuality to be the secret and ultimate answer to everything is a defence against the main discovery of psychoanalysis.
	- Thesis of psychoanalysis: **sex is considered dirty and in need of regulation because something about it is involved in the ontological inconsistency of the discursive being as such.**
- Accusation: psychoanalysis as THE technology of biopolitics, condition of deployment of sexuality as resisting.
	- Psychoanalysis comes to save sexuality from its confinement, invented sexuality as confined.

Foucault's epochal shift in modern operation of power corresponds to psychoanalytic conceptualization of **the shift from the law of external authority to the logic of the superego** and 'discontent in civilization' related to it.
- [[Lacan]]: 'God is dead, nothing is permitted anymore.' Retreat of symbolic authority is followed by infinite scrutiny, generalized guilt.
- Freud's theory of superego is not psychologization of social power structure, it reminds us that the social power structure can already be fully operative at the level of 'individual psyche'.
- Foucault's **confessional structure is logic of the superego**.
- Two aspects of superego:
	- **disciplinary**; internalization of authority, Foucault's panopticon.
	- **economic**; perverse economy where the more virtuous the man is, the more severely and distrustfully the superego behaves.
		- Guilt comes from renounced drives in mutual reinforcement.
		- Superego binds 'pleasure with compulsion', makes pleasure an object of infinite scrutiny.

Both Foucault and Lacan quarreled against Freudo-Marxism (Lacan: **Sexo-leftism**), directly associated with the 'repressive hypothesis'. Their difference:
- sexuality and repression do not make sense without the third term of *Verdrangung* which **makes sex the delayed and displaced cause of its own repression**. Repression can take the form of incitement, deployment of sexuality.
	- Freud, superego is structural, the symptom in civilization. **Family and society are built from *Verdrangung***.
- Lacan: unconscious is the foundation/underpinning of the workings of power: **as discursive, power is structured above its own point of lapse/contradiction**.
	- **Primal repression**: the question is the relationship between the 'object' of power and power's own structural flaw.
	- There is no social bond (discourse) without *Verdrangung*. 
- Redoubling of unconscious; it is not simply about what is repressed, but also about where / why it gets dischargged.
	- question of the ==discursive/systemic repression that is being sustained (covered/exploited) with and through particular repressions and their different modalities.==

We are bound to discursive power because of a flaw of the discursive reality itself, because the gap of the unconscious is 'built into' speech and discourse as structuring our reality.
- NOT psychological; human flaws and dispositions.
- Power as social phenomenon is always a response to the impossibility of the discursive structure. The question of power is the question of *who/what has master over the hole/leak in the discursive*.
- unconscious - locus of contingency. Double contingency; both the fact that something unpredictable happened and the fact that it happened.
	(1) **contingency qua relativization** many possible worlds 
	(2) the present configuration is contingent because it is *open to its own inconsistency **(or not)***
	- unconscious is the inconsistency in the present.

Power and politics:
- 'life' as a domain of microphysical power already presupposes a 'political' division.
- wrong alternative of singular division vs multiplicity of power struggles.
- There is a divide that structures the multiplicity, distributes it in a certain way.
	- antagonism structures the field where social classes/groups appear.
	- Politics involves the reactivation of the gap implied in the structure.

For Foucault, 'power' functions in the same way as 'sexuality' does in Freud (polymorphous perversion etc.)

**The truth is not that everything is sexual, but that there is something that can make anything sexual, even sexual intercourse.**
- Difference between human sexuality and animal/plant sexuality is redoubling: 'sex is sexy'. Sex is dislocated in respect to its reproductive purpose and also in respect to itself. **The further the sex separts from 'pure' copulation, the more sexual it becomes. Sexuality gets sexualized in this constitutive interval that separates it from itself.**
- This redoubling is missing in biopolitics/biopower; we have think of that which can turn anything into a power structure.
