# Prologue: "A Hot Mind Over Chilly Things"

Ismene: "You have hot mind over chilly things".
- the worst things and situations are chilly, rather than hot, and it takes a very hot mind to truly engage with them and make others do as well.

Antagonism of the play pertains to the logic of reality in which the elements exist, surfaces in and through the conflict Creon/Antigone, defines the ground on which they stand.

Antigone's act and demand constitute the *inaugural fact/event of the play*.
- vs. [[Hamlet]], there is not even a ghost of authority testifying to the wrong. Antigone's subjectivizing conviction creates an afterimage that persists throughout the play.
- *Parallax view*, both the reality and its constitutive inherent twist in one and the same frame.
- Antigone's actions imply its own history; [[Oedipus the King]] and [[Oedipus at Colonus]] were written after.

Antigone is change from **blameless but "criminal" Oedipus rule** to **"civilized," business-as-usual rule.**
- Prehistory → history
- marked by Creon's inaugural excess which stains the "normal rule".
	- Forced normalization of a specific, singular moment. **Violence**: Creon violates the respect for the gap of the unconscious that pertains to the law.

Antigone necessarily emerges as an image with a "sublime beauty".

# 1 Violence, Terror, and Unwritten Laws

Antigone asserts that Creon violates something about state laws.
- "private is the political"; Antigone embodies the untenability of the public/private separation.
- Creon's excessive subjective violence is performed in the name of the state and public law.
	- Creon violates unwritten side of public, written laws.
	- **"We're not cannibals; we ate the last one yesterday."**
		- Cannibalism is a crime only retrospectively, it becomes a crime with the very occurence of the act of eating the "last".
		- **Constitution of law involves a discontinuity**, a sacred gap that cannot be derived linearly from the previous "natural state".
		- Crime transfigured into the realm of the **sacred**, crime is protected, kept away from the everyday workings of the rule of law, from empirical rule.
			- Sacred: something that has no place in the given symbolic order; the place of the sacred is the place of the nonplace. **Sacred form the inner limit of symbolic law: there is a hole in the fence (the last cannibal we ate).**
		- ***Unwritten laws make us keep our distance from the impossible point of the constitution of the symbolic law.***
	- Creon stages the feast of eating the last cannibal.
		- **obscenity**: violation of unwritten dimension, any empirical content that appears at this point can only be obscene.
- Antigone and Polyneices both don't get proper burials, they are "between two deaths" (Polyneices doesn't get to be burried and Antigone is buried alive).

Antigone's *perseverance* is different than Creon's *fixation*. She finds a way to make Creaon push the limit of the symbolic law all the way through until it crashes on him.
- Antigone's **personal singularity is at the core of public law: the personal concerns the public sphere.**
- Antigone: *you cannot push the limits without consequences, she is willing to be that consequence, she feels she can't help but be that consequence*
	- Ethics: the claim applies in practice only when there is an **antagonist** like Antigone.

**State violence** (vs systemic violence) involves the illegal practices to which state power can resort simply because it is the state, sometimes outsourcing dirty deeds.
- [[Assange]] was buried alive for exposing.
- Ruling shamelessly: repeating illegal constitution of the sate, like eating the last cannibal over and over again.
	- "impossible" crime to be kept away from → special weapon
- Courageous transgression of state laws by avoiding the "hypocracy" that laws sometimes demand is **direct identification with the obscene other side of power itself**. They are "transgressing" their own laws.
	- Libidinal appeal of new populisms and their leaders.
	- Current situation is bleak oscillation between "bureaucracy" and "transgression".

*[[Germany in Autumn]]* (1978): RAF combatted state violence by emulating it: what state powers call "terrorism" is simply state violence without a state covering up or supporting this illegal violence.
- Antigone has double position on terrorism: she wants to bury the terrorist and her act of perseverence is itself perceived as an act of terror: 'even if she is right in her claim, her insistence and persistence are wrong'.
