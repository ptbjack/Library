# Introduction

It is not clear what exactly the field of psychoanalysis is.
Freud attacked both for ‘biologism’ and ‘cultural relativism’. 
His discovery is the overlapping of the physical and mental realms.
- Overlapping = intersection which is generative of both sides that overlap in it.
- Culture springs from the impasses of the somatic functions which it tries to resolve, but creates new ones.
[[Lacan]]: Psychoanalysis won’t ‘stay in its field of therapy’, it has intrinsically social, objective, and critical dimension. It is not about the individuals and their intimate problems- these are inscribed into the socio-symbolic field ‘Other’.

# Intervention 1
## Sexuality and Ontology

Does the insistence on the sexual particularize psychoanalysis (vs universal scope of philosophy)?
- Sexuality is the sine qua non of any true psychoanalytic stance.
- Treating it as secondary produces ‘psychologized philosophy’, philosophy that puts at its center the investigation of the human animal and its soul.
	- E.g. Jung
- Freud and Lacan are unshaken about sexuality being primary, and influence philosophy.
	- E.g. Badiou, who refuses to associate subjectivity with anything like ‘sexuation’ but engages with Freud and Lacan.
- Sexuality is ‘left at the door’, is ‘missed encounter’ that only allows for any true encounter between philosophy and psychoanalysis in their heterogeneity.

## Freud and Three Essays

Freud discovered sexuality as a problem in need of explanation, not as something with which one could eventually explain every other problem.
- Three Essays: sexuality is a paradox-ridden deviation from a norm that does not exist.
	- ‘Aberrant’ mechanisms (deviation from object, reproductive aim) are also present in what is considered to be ‘natural’ sexual behavior.
	- Drives are partial, aimless, and independent of their object to start with. They do not become such due to some ulterior deviation.

Object a names the other (the real) object of the drive as “independent of its object”.
- E.g. thumb sucking: oral satisfaction, a by-product of the satisfying of the need for food, starts to function as an autonomous object.
- All satisfaction of a need allows for another satisfaction to occur, which tends to become independent and self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself. There is no pure natural need devoid of this surplus element which splits it from within.
	- This split is the site of grounding of human sexuality.

Sexual != genital
- Genital organization is a result, unifies originally heterogeneous, always-already compound sexual drive.
	- Unification is artificial, and never fully accomplished.

Libido names the ‘energy’ involved in the processes of supplementary satisfaction. This means sexual, and sexual intercourse is properly sexual on account of being composed of different partial drives such as looking, touching, licking etc.
Jung: ‘libido’ as psychic energy not solely sexual.
Freud: libido designates original and irreducible unbalance of human nature due to supplementary satisfactions.
The generative source of culture is sexual in the sense of belonging to the supplementary satisfaction that serves no immediate function and satisfies no immediate need.
Surplus energy, not-whole.

Freud: there is no ‘natural’ or pre-established place of human sexuality, it is constitutively out-of-place.
No substance to be properly described and circumscribed, it is the very impossibility of its own circumscription or delimitation.
Lacan: the Sexual does not exist, there is only the sexual that insists/persists as a constitutive imbalance of the human being.
## Lacan and the 'lamella'

Psychoanalysis vs ‘psychologized’ philosophy: the sexual insists as a factor of radical disorientation, keeps bringing into question all our representations of the entity called ‘human being’.
- Sexuality allows for universal theory of the subject that is the singular, concretely-universal point of its inherent contradiction.

Lacan: think of libido not as energy but lamella, an ‘unreal organ’
- Like amoeba, extra-flat, immortal (survives any division). 
- Instead of Aristophanian myth of humans having Oneness and later split.
- Loss is not in splitting but with the occurrence of sexual reproduction.
	- Joining, not adding, has constitutive loss or reduction.
- Libido = loss

## A concept of an ontological impasse

[[Freud]]’s account of being as sexual is similar to [[Badiou]]’s theory of pure being as pure ‘excess beyond itself’, as pure multiple inconsistent to start with which can only stop not in ‘one’ but in void.
- The sexual is being, being is not sexual
- ‘The sexual’ as the psychoanalytic name for the inconsistency of being.

The unconscious is not a subjective distortion of the objective world, it is an indication of a fundamental inconsistency of the objective world itself, which allows for and generates its own distortions.
- Unconscious bears witness to a problematic character of the ‘objective reality’.
- Popular ideological maneuver recognizes the rights of the subjective as subjective, and not as a possible indication of something objective, of objective malfunction.

**‘Unconscious is outside’**: constitutive gap in the Other is the condition of possibility of the subject’s ‘own’ repressions.
- Repression fills in the gaps of (objective) reality.
- Subjective distortions are distortions at the place of something that is not.

Sexual meanings revealed in therapy mask the reality of drives, it is a means of satisfaction through meaning, satisfaction in the production of sexual meaning. Psychoanalysis tries to deactivate the path of this satisfaction, to make it useless.
- The being of the drive is lack-of-being
- Drive is the being of the lack/void.
- The sexual is the edge of meaning, inner limit; the point of consistency of being that induces production of meaning.
- Drive is the impossible joint articulation of being and meaning in their heterogeneity.

[[Althusser]]: both Marxism and Freud
- [[Conflictual Sciences]]: Part of the very reality they recognize as conflictual and antagonistic.
- In social conflict, ‘neutral’ position is always and necessarily the position of the ruling class.
- The criterion of objectivity is not neutrality but the capacity of theory to occupy a singular, specific point of view within the situation.
	- Some positions dissimulate conflict, some reveal it. One can discover the essence of conflictual reality by occupying certain positions and not others in this very conflict.
- Their worst enemy is not direct opposition, but revisionism.
	- Needs to be neutralized through revision, touched upon something true and dangerous.


[[Heidegger]]: being-towards-death → [[Lacan]]: being-towards-sex
# Intervention 2
## Freedom and cause

Forced choice in psychoanalysis: The choice, supposed to imply a certain freedom, is that through which the subject emerges as subjected to the symbolic order and determined by it.
* “Freedom or death”; only way to choose freedom is to choose death and show that you have freedom of choice.

Freedom: possibility of real qualitative shift is inscribed in the theory and practice of psychoanalysis

## "There is but the cause of that which does not work"

No ‘free subject’ that has freedom as essential attribute.
* Lacan: subject is the effect of the structure, it is anything but free.
* Subject is the point of regularity, of structure, in which the structure breaks down or displays inner contradiction, negativity, contingency, interruption, or a lack of its own foundation.

Cause = discontinuity (what caused this slip of the tongue?)
* Freedom only appears when something has a cause
* There is no smooth passage between ‘manifest’ and the ‘latent’
	* Cause as the articulation of their non-relationship

“Il n’y a de cause que de ce qui cloche”
Non-immediate character of the causal relationship
Hume: irreducible leap in the connection between cause and effect
Kant: rational subjectivity as transcendental constitutive background against which the leap is possible without the causal structure simply falling apart.
Causal relation connects two things in their very split.
Lacan: cause vs law
## Laplanche and the cause of the unconscious

Children’s seduction by adults: is it an event in material, empirical reality or a fantasy later construed in psychical reality?
* Laplanche: material cause that cannot be reduced to empirical event.
	* Third material reality of the enigmatic message.
	* Enigmatic message not only so for the receiver but also for the sender.
* Constitution of the unconscious as the refuse of interpretations of enigmatic messages (left out, repressed)?
	* Leftover is not identified with unconscious, unconscious is already an interpretation.
	* Unconscious is the interpretation which strives to incorporate this object (leftover) into its narrative. It interprets with respect to the leftover.
	* Unconscious it that which continues to interpret after the conscious interpretation is done.
		* Interprets the relationship between the given interpretation and its leftover from the point of view of the leftover.
		* It’s interpretation is inscribed in the dimension of truth.

Three elements:
* Subjective figure related to the formations of the unconscious
* Two causes:
	* Elements of ‘enigmatic messages’ circulating in the Other (words, gestures, gazes etc.)
	* Object-like surplus/leftover of the interpretation of these messages
		* Problematic relationship of this object with interpreting subject: something does not add up in the relationship between the subject and the Other, between the subject’s being and meaning.
		* It relates the subject and the Other in their heterogeneity, the inexistence of their common denominator.

‘Enigmatic message’ suggests mystery of meaning (que vuoi?), which involves presupposition that the other knows.
* Enigmatic message = encounter with inconsistent reality + presupposition of meaning
* Subject must have had already ‘chosen’ meaning
	* Lacan’s forced choice: subject of the unconscious is what emerges when he can choose only meaning between being and meaning.
* Constitution of the unconscious coincides with the presupposition of meaning.
	* Repression of the first representation that eludes interpretation only possible against the background of forced choice.
* Enigma is secondary to forced choice

## The object of freedom

What is the ‘it’ that ‘means’?
* It is that which does not work in the interaction
	* Free-floating radical
	* We interpret everything else, this object is the motor of the interpretation
- Supposition of meaning situates the object in the field of Other
	- The Other that has the object is the enigmatic Other, we are sure they have a meaning.
	* Supposition of meaning excludes the unconscious of the Other, the Other knows and is coherent.
		* Asymmetrical interaction between child-adult
		* Missed encounter: the unconscious of the Other is ‘sacrificed’ in the constitution of the subject’s own unconscious.

The Other guarantees the consistency of the field of meaning, knows everything except that it does not exist (that it is inconsistent)
* Singular ignorance enables the preposition that the Other knows
* And makes possible disavowal: “I know very well but I nevertheless do.”
* So, any change in our unconscious must be made in the Other.

Three elements in the same line:
* Surplus of distortion between the manifest and latent content
* Leftover of the conscious interpretation
- The drive
	* Embodies inner split of all satisfaction (possibility of supplemental satisfaction), 
	* de-centering the subject and the Other:
		* Subject finds satisfaction through the detour of the Other.
			* Detour is irreducible (i.e. transference is inevitable illusion)
Enjoyment and repression mutually sustain each other
	* Exists through and as the articulation of the non-relationship between subject and the Other.
* All three are different articulations of the navel through which the empirical life of every subject is related to its constitutive conditions in the Other.
	* Navel = Lacanian ‘object a’
		* If the Other is the symbolic coordinates that structure our word and provide its vocabulary, object a is an effect of the Other.
		* Object a is the point where the effect maintains an ‘open line’ with the symbolic structure that generates it so that the structure is dependent, ‘vulnerable’ to this object.
	* Analysis relies on double presupposition:
		* The object can be found in the unconscious formation
		* Something can be changed/shifted through it
	* Symptom
		- Rigid symbolic form
		* Also a continuous process, the site of conflict determining the subject

Work of analysis is separating the answer from the Other, subject realizes that the answer lies as an indivisible remainder of his actions in relation to the Other.

Levinas promotes repression to the rank of the highest ethical maxim.
* The Other demands our interpretation, and we are responsible for this interpretation.
* The Other is only a catalyst, the enigma is the point through which the subject refers to itself via the constitutive interval of interpretation.
- Close to the vicious circle of the superego
- Endless responsibility
	* Vs. Psychoanalysis: singular responsibility in relation to the singular object which is the decentered point through which the Other and its corresponding subjectivity are being maintained or not.
		* Causality through object

## Some (un)timely observations

Work of analysis is de-interpretations since symptoms themselves are interpretations/synthesis.
* Analytical
* Synthesis is always on the side of repression.
* Free associations disintegrate coherent story, take elements in divergent directions, introduce new elements etc. 
	* Against symbolism (“symptoms have meaning”)
* Separation = isolating the drive and its object
	* Lacan: drive finds its satisfaction without attaining its aim.
	* Drive is not element but elementary form of the split that precedes the elements split in it.
	* Object of drive is the gap itself as object.
	* Split entails the division between the mental and the physical and their possible articulation.
		* E.g. culture and nature, 
			* drive is short-circuit between them
			* Drive is intersection which is generative of both sides that overlap it.
				* Humans are many points where the difference between biology and the symbolic and themselves as defined by this difference are generated, the relationship between the who dimensions is being constantly negotiated (posited, repeated, solidified, defined, and redefined).
				* No ‘pure life’ or ‘pure symbolic’, paradoxical joint:
					* Autonomous field of the symbolic is produced at the periphery of movement generated by the intersection and retroactively affects its own point of generation.
	* Analysis stumbles against the subject of the drive that binds the self and the otherness in their very split.

We do not live in times of accelerated dissolution of the social ties or the emergence of an untied multitude of individuals as solipsistic islands of enjoyment, the existence of the multiplicity is precisely the form of existence of the contemporary social link.
* Enjoyment is always-already social, linked to the Other.
* The Other guarantees the repression that the enjoyment needs in order to emerge as enjoyment.

Big Other no longer has any hold on us in the guise of a concrete, ‘small’ other.
* The Other is preserved as empty place
* The symbolic order appears as a playground within which we are free yet we are utterly powerless in relation to the crucial parameters of this socio-economic structure itself.
	* Radical foreclosure of the cause, of the object-cause, and freedom.
	* Freedom becomes abstract ‘freedom of choice’

# Intervention 3
## The uncertain limit

The comic feeling and the feeling of the uncanny (Unheimliche) are two modes of deploying the Nothing.
* Comedy points to the irreducible materiality of nothing.
	* E.g. coffee without milk joke
		* ‘Cream’ appears in its spectral dimension, deprived of its symbolic standing but insisting in the real.
		* Lack hanging on to partial objects
	* Not symbolic rendering of nothing (‘nothing appearing as something, e.g. 0), remainder of nothing, insisting in the real, while being deprived of its symbolic support.
	* Verbal comedy, spectral object seen when figures of speech are taken literally (ignoring the gap that makes them symbolic) or treating ‘immaterial’ things as objects.
		* E.g. Marx brother, ‘try my patience’
			* Elimination of gap that separates mental and physical objects, gap normally serves as a negative condition of ‘making sense’, appears now as substantial.
* They share ‘materiality of the spectral’ and the production of the ‘impossible’ objects
* Definitions could be applied to both:
	* Bergson: the comical is “something mechanical encrusted on something living”.
	* Schelling: the uncanny is “everything that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light”.
* Pfaller: four essential commonalities:
	* Symbolic causality (something starts as a play and takes the upper hand, functioning in the real)
	* Success (everything succeeds too much)
	* repetition
	* Figure of the double

## "Theatrical illusion"

Mannoni’s example of dead man on stage, sneezing. Comedy is what is uncanny for others.
* Could be fetishistic disavowal.
	* We can ‘believe’ what is on stage by presupposing some others who would believe the performance real (identifying with the gaze of the Other who is supposedly fooled by the performance).
* But we lose the third reality which cannot be reduced to empirical reality or the illusion sustained by fetishistic disavowal.
	* Theatrical reality has same status as the ‘material reality of an enigmatic message’ of Laplanche.
	* Question of truth concerns the relationship between what we see and the real that structures it.
	* We delegate our explicit knowledge of ‘how things really stand’ to the Other, so that we can indulge in believing what we see, the Other is the guarantee that outside the play there is a reality firmly in its place.

Uncanny is when the explicit knowledge deposited in the Other no longer supports our reality, when the subject is alone in seeing that there is something wrong with what is happening with no Other to support her knowledge.

Comical, 
* Feeling of reassurance that the Other is still guaranteeing the reality outside fiction, supporting the constitutive division between reality and the real.
* Funny vs comical: funny when the ‘reality-self’ of the actor displays a lack in the edifice of representation.
	* Comical is when the frame delimiting the space of ‘fiction’ appears within its own scope in the form of the comic object.
		* Simultaneous appearance of the Other and the object a on the same level is a comic scene par excellence.
* The object of comedy is not the sneeze, but that space or zone that simultaneously separates and links the sneezing and its body, the voice and its source, the smile and its face, etc.

## Nothing remains to be seen

Ordinary life involves fundamental negativity as the condition of differentiality.
* Vs always-already symbolically mediated lack, which a symbol can fill in, designate its place, absence. (‘posited negativity’)

Lacan: uncanny, “the lack comes to lack”, surplus object emerges in its place, has no place in given reality.
* The lack comes to lack in object a, anxiety implies a certainty bound to this object.
* Eyes being plucked out
	* Instead of eyes, two empty holes in the person’s face
		* The holes are all too shallow, all too finite, their bottom all too visible and close.
		* The moment when the lack loses its symbolic or/and imaginary support, it becomes ‘a mere hole,’ an object. It is a nothing that remains there to be seen.
	* Eyes themselves appear as ghastly, impossible objects
		* ‘Openings into the soul’ → surplus ‘abject’
* Castration complex functions as the pivotal point of our experience because it provided a symbolic rendering, support, a way of dealing with the ‘lack in the real’.
	* Anxiety involves the menace of losing the castration itself.
		* Ghastly objects dislodge the object of desire and make appear the cause of desire.

## The realism of desire versus the realism of drive

Difference between comedy and the uncanny:
* Uncanny relies on the structure of desire, based on the antinomy of the object of desire and its transcendent cause.
	* Object-cause is constitutively excluded from the field of desire, from the Other.
	* If the object-cause emerges on the level of the Other, it produces the uncanny.
		* The figure of the double is the mirror image in which the object a is included. Imaginary coincides with the real, provokes anxiety.
			* Double = me + a
			* We see the a with a nod or wink, or mirror image closes its eyes, makes gaze appear.
		* Over-realization of embracing the Cause in self-destruction is what desire fantasizes about.
		* Realism of desire: the constitutive lack cannot come to be lacking without the reality constructed around this lack falling apart.
* Comedy has an unrealistic stance: the lack comes to lack, the ghastly object appears where it should not, the Other and the object appear on the same level. Nothing really happens though.
	* Incredible + down-to-earth realism
	* Vitalism: realism of drives.
		* Realism of the death drive; vitalism of the internal contradiction of human life itself.
		* Excess of life
	* *Constitutive dislocation*: the object of comedy is the interval that separates and links  the sneezing and its body, the habit and its bearer.
