# Vol. 1: An Introduction
## I. We "Other Victorians"

Repression story:
- In 17th century, Victorian bourgeoisie, sexuality was confined into the home, the conjugal family absorbed it into the function of reproduction. The parents' bedroom became the single locus of sexuality acknowledged in social space.
- Other sexualities had no right to exist, they were repressed: sentence to disappear, admission that there was nothing to say, see and know about such things.
	- Made room for them in the brothel and the mental hospital, included in the circuits of profit, transferred unspoken pleasures into the order of things that are counted.
- Freeing ourselves from repression requires transgression, irruption of speech, new economy in the mechanism of power.
	- Truth is conditioned by politics, psychoanalysis is conformist, normalizing.
- Tying the age of repression to development of capitalism is a political guarantee of this discourse: "Sex is repressed because it is incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative."

Speaker's benefit: The mere fact that one is speaking about sex has the appearance of a deliberate transgression. The person places himself outsde the reach of power; he somehow anticipates the coming freedom.
- "Tomorrow sex will be good again."
- We are eager to speak of repression of sex because it gives us opportunity to speak out against power, to utter truths and promise bliss.

Sex serves as a suppport for preaching (chastising old order, praising the rights of the immediate and the real)
* The statement of oppression and the form of the sermon are mutually reinforcing.

Society speaks verbosely of its own silence.
- Why do we say that we are repressed?
- Is the critical discourse part of the same historical network as the thing it denounces? Was there really a historical rupture between the age of repression and the critical analysis of repression?
- How to account for the fact that sex is spoken about?
	- Discursive fact: the way in which sex is "put into discourse."
	- Polymorphous techniques of power.

## II. The Repressive Hypothesis
### 1. The Incitement to Discourse

Since the 17th century, calling sex by its name became more difficult and costly, censorship.
- Control over enunciations: where and when it is not possible to talk about sex.

At the level of discourse, **proliferation of specific discourses**. Institutional incitement to speak about sex; to cause it to speak through explicit articulation and detail.
- Catholic pastoral after the Council of Trent (1545-1563):
	- Refined language in confessions, no sexual positions described, discretion is advised.
	- Scope of the confession continually increased: sex must not be named but its aspects and effects must be pursued down to their smallest ramifications, **shifting the moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings of desire.**
	- Nearly infinite task of telling everything that might concern the interplay of pleasures and thoughts which had some affinity with sex.
	- **Imperative: You will seek to transform your desire into discourse.**
	- Censoring was secondary to the ways of rendering it morally acceptable and technically useful.
	- Sade, *My Secret Life*, were more telling of sexuality in this era than Victorian puritanism.
- Constant optimization and valorization of the discourse on sex, producing specific effects on desire by merely transforming into discourse.

18th century, political, economic and technical incitement to talk about sex. Analysis, classification, specification of quantitative and causal studies.
- Need for rational discourse on sex.
- Sex as not judged but administered, policed.
- Necessity of regulating sex through useful and public discourses.
	- ***Population*** as an economic and political problem which has its specific phenomena and peculiar variables (birth/death rates, fertility, patterns of diet, etc.)
	- Society affirmed that its future was tied to the manner in which each individual made use of his sex. **Sex became a public issue between the state and the individual.**

Child sexuality:
- Silence as an element that functions alongside the things said. Different ways of not saying such things.
- 18th century secondary schools: Nothing is "said" about sex but it is a constant preoccupation for the whole internal organization. The internal discourse of the institution was based on the assumption that child sexuality existed and that it was active and ever present.
- Discursive orthopedics; Philanthropium (1776) first communion of adolescent sex and reasonable discourse. 
- The pedagogical institution multiplied the forms of discourse on child sexuality and qualified speakers.

Sites, centers of discourse:
- psychiatry, focuses its gaze on "excess", masturbation, frustration.
- criminal justice broadened its juristiction to include petty offenses, insignificant perversions.
	- everyday occurence in the life of village sexuality becomes the object of medical intervention, clinical examination.

Not simply continual extension, rather **a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated**. Modern societies have dedicated themselves to speaking of sex *ad infinitum*, while exploiting it as *the* secret.

### 2. The Perverse Implantation

Even if the concern is to ensure population, to constitute a sexuality that is economically useful, the method employed by 19-20th century is **multiplication; dispersion of sexualities, strengthening of disparate forms, multiple implantation of "perversions".**

Until 19th Century, canonical law, the Christian pastoral and civil law determined the division between licit and illicit and **were centered on matrimonial relations**. Marriage relations beset by rules and recommendations, the "rest" remained confused.
- No clear distinction between violations of the rules of marriage and deviations with respect to genitality (equal measure of condemnation).
- Prohibitions based on law: hermaphrodites were criminals, their being confounded the law that distinguished the sexes and prescribed their union.

Discursive explosion:
- Heterosexual monogamy spoken of less and less. The legitimate couple had a right to more discretion.
- Sexuality of children, mad men and women, and criminals came under scrutiny; they were listened to.
- Setting apart of the **"unnatural" as a specific dimension in the field of sexuality**: separated infractions against marriage/family and offenses against the regularity of a natural function.
	- Birth of a sub-race; named "moral folly", "genital neurosis", "degenerescence", "physical imbalance".
- Permissiveness; law often deffered to medicine, which created organic, functional, or mental pathology arising out of "incomplete" sexual practices, incorporated them into the notions of "development" and instinctual "disturbances", and undertook to manage them.

Four operations of power, different from simple prohibition:
1. Infantile sexuality, propagation of power and of the object on which it was brought to bear. Constituting masturbation as secret waiting to be discovered, installing devices of surveillance, traps for compelling admissions. **Child sexuality was demanded to persevere and proliferate to the limits of the visible and the invisible.** Power penetrates into reality through ***lines of penetration***.
2. ***Incorporation of perversions*** and ***specification of individuals***.
	- 19th century homosexual became a personage. Nothing that went into his total composition was unaffected by his sexuality. The sodomite had been a temporary abberation, the homosexual was now a species.
	- Entomologizing, names for heresies (zoophiles, gynecomasts, sexoesthetic inverts, etc.); not suppressing but giving an analytical, visible and permanent reality to them. 
		- Specification and the regional solidification of each abberant sexuality. 
	- Strategy of incorporating them into the individual.
3. Power and the body: sensualization of power and gain of pleasure.
	- Power presupposed proximities, implied a physical proximity and an interplay of intense sensations.
	- One had to detect sexuality as a medical object, as a dysfunction or symptom.
	- Emotional reward to the overseeing control, pleasure discovered fed back to the power that encircled it, as well as pleasure that comes from having to evade power, fool it.
	- **Perpetual spirals of power and pleasure**
4. Devices of sexual saturation
	- circulating sexuality; family as network of pleasures and powers linked according to transformable relationships.
		- not polar parents vs children

19th century "bourgeois" society was that of blatant and fragmented perversion.
- Power acted by **multiplication of singular sexualities.** It included sexuality in the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic.
- The growth of perversions is the real product of the encroachment of a type of power on bodies and their pleasures. 
- Relations of power to sex and pleasure multiplied through isolation, intensification, and consolidation. Scattered sexualities rigidified.
- Pleasure and power seek out, overlap and reinforce one another.
- Each local sexuality gave a surface of intervention; analytical multiplication of pleasure and optimization of the power that controls it.
