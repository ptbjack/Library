# Vol. 1: An Introduction
## I. We "Other Victorians"

Repression story:
- In 17th century, Victorian bourgeoisie, sexuality was confined into the home, the conjugal family absorbed it into the function of reproduction. The parents' bedroom became the single locus of sexuality acknowledged in social space.
- Other sexualities had no right to exist, they were repressed: sentence to disappear, admission that there was nothing to say, see and know about such things.
	- Made room for them in the brothel and the mental hospital, included in the circuits of profit, transferred unspoken pleasures into the order of things that are counted.
- Freeing ourselves from repression requires transgression, irruption of speech, new economy in the mechanism of power.
	- Truth is conditioned by politics, psychoanalysis is conformist, normalizing.
- Tying the age of repression to development of capitalism is a political guarantee of this discourse: "Sex is repressed because it is incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative."

Speaker's benefit: The mere fact that one is speaking about sex has the appearance of a deliberate transgression. The person places himself outsde the reach of power; he somehow anticipates the coming freedom.
- "Tomorrow sex will be good again."
- We are eager to speak of repression of sex because it gives us opportunity to speak out against power, to utter truths and promise bliss.

Sex serves as a suppport for preaching (chastising old order, praising the rights of the immediate and the real)
* The statement of oppression and the form of the sermon are mutually reinforcing.

Society speaks verbosely of its own silence.
- Why do we say that we are repressed?
- Is the critical discourse part of the same historical network as the thing it denounces? Was there really a historical rupture between the age of repression and the critical analysis of repression?
- How to account for the fact that sex is spoken about?
	- Discursive fact: the way in which sex is "put into discourse."
	- Polymorphous techniques of power.

## II. The Repressive Hypothesis
### 1. The Incitement to Discourse

Since the 17th century, calling sex by its name became more difficult and costly, censorship.
- Control over enunciations: where and when it is not possible to talk about sex.

At the level of discourse, **proliferation of specific discourses**. Institutional incitement to speak about sex; to cause it to speak through explicit articulation and detail.
- Catholic pastoral after the Council of Trent (1545-1563):
	- Refined language in confessions, no sexual positions described, discretion is advised.
	- Scope of the confession continually increased: sex must not be named but its aspects and effects must be pursued down to their smallest ramifications, **shifting the moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings of desire.**
	- Nearly infinite task of telling everything that might concern the interplay of pleasures and thoughts which had some affinity with sex.
	- **Imperative: You will seek to transform your desire into discourse.**
	- Censoring was secondary to the ways of rendering it morally acceptable and technically useful.
	- Sade, *My Secret Life*, were more telling of sexuality in this era than Victorian puritanism.
- Constant optimization and valorization of the discourse on sex, producing specific effects on desire by merely transforming into discourse.

18th century, political, economic and technical incitement to talk about sex. Analysis, classification, specification of quantitative and causal studies.
- Need for rational discourse on sex.
- Sex as not judged but administered, policed.
- Necessity of regulating sex through useful and public discourses.
	- ***Population*** as an economic and political problem which has its specific phenomena and peculiar variables (birth/death rates, fertility, patterns of diet, etc.)
	- Society affirmed that its future was tied to the manner in which each individual made use of his sex. **Sex became a public issue between the state and the individual.**

Child sexuality:
- Silence as an element that functions alongside the things said. Different ways of not saying such things.
- 18th century secondary schools: Nothing is "said" about sex but it is a constant preoccupation for the whole internal organization. The internal discourse of the institution was based on the assumption that child sexuality existed and that it was active and ever present.
- Discursive orthopedics; Philanthropium (1776) first communion of adolescent sex and reasonable discourse. 
- The pedagogical institution multiplied the forms of discourse on child sexuality and qualified speakers.

Sites, centers of discourse:
- psychiatry, focuses its gaze on "excess", masturbation, frustration.
- criminal justice broadened its juristiction to include petty offenses, insignificant perversions.
	- everyday occurence in the life of village sexuality becomes the object of medical intervention, clinical examination.

Not simply continual extension, rather **a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated**. Modern societies have dedicated themselves to speaking of sex *ad infinitum*, while exploiting it as *the* secret.

### 2. The Perverse Implantation

Even if the concern is to ensure population, to constitute a sexuality that is economically useful, the method employed by 19-20th century is **multiplication; dispersion of sexualities, strengthening of disparate forms, multiple implantation of "perversions".**

Until 19th Century, canonical law, the Christian pastoral and civil law determined the division between licit and illicit and **were centered on matrimonial relations**. Marriage relations beset by rules and recommendations, the "rest" remained confused.
- No clear distinction between violations of the rules of marriage and deviations with respect to genitality (equal measure of condemnation).
- Prohibitions based on law: hermaphrodites were criminals, their being confounded the law that distinguished the sexes and prescribed their union.

Discursive explosion:
- Heterosexual monogamy spoken of less and less. The legitimate couple had a right to more discretion.
- Sexuality of children, mad men and women, and criminals came under scrutiny; they were listened to.
- Setting apart of the **"unnatural" as a specific dimension in the field of sexuality**: separated infractions against marriage/family and offenses against the regularity of a natural function.
	- Birth of a sub-race; named "moral folly", "genital neurosis", "degenerescence", "physical imbalance".
- Permissiveness; law often deffered to medicine, which created organic, functional, or mental pathology arising out of "incomplete" sexual practices, incorporated them into the notions of "development" and instinctual "disturbances", and undertook to manage them.

Four operations of power, different from simple prohibition:
1. Infantile sexuality, propagation of power and of the object on which it was brought to bear. Constituting masturbation as secret waiting to be discovered, installing devices of surveillance, traps for compelling admissions. **Child sexuality was demanded to persevere and proliferate to the limits of the visible and the invisible.** Power penetrates into reality through ***lines of penetration***.
2. ***Incorporation of perversions*** and ***specification of individuals***.
	- 19th century homosexual became a personage. Nothing that went into his total composition was unaffected by his sexuality. The sodomite had been a temporary abberation, the homosexual was now a species.
	- Entomologizing, names for heresies (zoophiles, gynecomasts, sexoesthetic inverts, etc.); not suppressing but giving an analytical, visible and permanent reality to them. 
		- Specification and the regional solidification of each abberant sexuality. 
	- Strategy of incorporating them into the individual.
3. Power and the body: sensualization of power and gain of pleasure.
	- Power presupposed proximities, implied a physical proximity and an interplay of intense sensations.
	- One had to detect sexuality as a medical object, as a dysfunction or symptom.
	- Emotional reward to the overseeing control, pleasure discovered fed back to the power that encircled it, as well as pleasure that comes from having to evade power, fool it.
	- **Perpetual spirals of power and pleasure**
4. Devices of sexual saturation
	- circulating sexuality; family as network of pleasures and powers linked according to transformable relationships.
		- not polar parents vs children

19th century "bourgeois" society was that of blatant and fragmented perversion.
- Power acted by **multiplication of singular sexualities.** It included sexuality in the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic.
- The growth of perversions is the real product of the encroachment of a type of power on bodies and their pleasures. 
- Relations of power to sex and pleasure multiplied through isolation, intensification, and consolidation. Scattered sexualities rigidified.
- Pleasure and power seek out, overlap and reinforce one another.
- Each local sexuality gave a surface of intervention; analytical multiplication of pleasure and optimization of the power that controls it.

## III. Scientia Sexualis

Until Freud, the discouse of scholars and theoriticians on sex invented precautions and analyses, so many procedures meant to **evade the hazardous truth of sex**.
- Rarefied, neutral viewpoint of a science subordinated to the imperatives of a morality whose divisions it reiterated under the guise of the medical norm.
- *Fin de siecle* society, pornography of the morbid.
- Claim to ensure the physical vigor and the moral cleanliness of the social body, science justified the racisms of te state and grounded them in "truth".
- Two orders of knowledge:
	1. biology of reproduction, general scientific normativity
		- Will to knowledge
	2. medicine of sex
		- Will to nonknowledge: systematic blindness. Choosing not to recognize is another vagary of the will to truth.
		- Charcot's Salpetriere: continuous incitement to discourse and to truth, mechanisms of misnuderstanding (Charcot's interruptions of public consultation, deleting information from dossiers)
	- **First is the fictitious guarantee of the second, allowing moral, economic and political options to be recast in a scientific-sounding vocabulary.**
- Sex as a problem of truth, endeavor to tell the truth of sex.


Two procedures for producing the truth of sex:
- *ars erotica:* truth drawn from pleasure itself. Pleasure is in relation to itself.
	- Knowledge that must remain secret, held in great reserve, loses its effectiveness and its virtue by being divulved.
	- Knowledge deflected back into sexual practice to amplify its effects.
- ***scientia sexualis:*** knowledge-power opposed to the art of initiations and masterful secret. **Confession** produces truth (Western man has become a confessing animal):
	- sacrament of penance, Lateran Council 1215.
	- *avowal* changed meaning: guarantee of status, identity, value granted to one person to another → someone's acknowledgment of his own actions and thoughts.
	- Literature: heroic or marvelous narration of "trials" of bravery → infinite task of extracting a truth in between the words.
	- Philosophy: self-examination that yields the basic certainties of consciousness through a multitude of fleeting impressions.
	- We no longer perceive confession as the effect of a power that constrains us, we think that truth "demands" only to surface ("confession frees", but power reduces one to silence)
		- **The production of truth is imbued with relations of power.**
	- The obligation to conceal sex could be another aspect of the duty to admit to it.
		- Truth and sex are joined in the confession, through the obligatory and exhaustive expression of an individual secret.

 In confession, **the speaking subject is also the subject of the statement.**
- Power relationship in the ritual: the presence of a partner who is the authority requiring, appreciating the confession
	- Agency of domination resides in the one who listens and says nothing, questions and is **not supposed to know**.
- Expression alone produces intrinsic modifications in the person who articulates it: it unburdens him of wrongs and promises salvation.
- **discourse comes from below**, as obligatory act of speech which breaks the bonds of discretion and forgetfulness.
- Presupposed secrecy comes from its obscure familiarity and general baseness.
- Accuracy comes from the intimacy of discourse and discourse takes efect in the one from whom it is wrested, not in the one who receives it.

After Protestanism and Counter Reformation, the confession lost its exclusive localization, spread and was employed in a series of relationships. No longer a question of simply saying what was done -the sexual act- but of reconstructing the thoughts, obsessions, images, desires, quality of the pleasure that animated it.
- Discourse was solidified by medicine, psychiatry, and pedagogy (indefinite record of people's pleasures)
- Singular pleasures were called upon to pronounce a discourse of truth (discourse of science: bodies and life processes) concerning themselves.
- **Redoubling of discourse, interference between procedures of confession and scientific discursivity.**
	1. *Clinical codification of the inducement to speak*: reinscribing the procedure of confession in a field of scientifically acceptable observations through interrogation, questionnaire, recollection of memories and free association.
	2. *Postulate of general and diffuse causality*: imputing sexual etiology to everything, principle of sex as a "cause of any and everything" underlying constant, thorough confession operating within a scientific type of practice.
	3. *Principle of a latency intrinsic to sexuality*: sex is elusive in nature, confession in 19th century concerned with what was hidden from the subject. It was possible to link the forcing of a difficult confession to a scientific practice since it involved something that tried to stay hidden.
	4. *Method of interpretation*: Truth constituted in two stages, revelation of confession coupled with the decipherment of what it said.
		- Hermaneutic function of the master of truth.
		- Confession no longer as a test but as a sign, needing to be interpreted.
	5. *Medicalization of the effects of confession*: no longer sin/excess/transgression, sex placed under the rule of **the normal and the pathological**.
		- Sex deriving its meanings and necessity from medical interventions.
		- **The truth healed** when spoken in time, to the proper party, by the person who was both the bearer and the one responsible for it.
- Complex machinery connecting the ancient injunction of confession to clinical listening methods. "Sexuality" embodies the truth of sex and its pleasures.
	- Sexuality defined as being "by nature", a domain calling for therapeutic and normalizing interventions, an obscure speech (parole) that had to be ferreted out and listened to.
	- NOT a system of representations but the "economy" of discourses.
- 19th century society set out to **formulate the uniform truth of sex**.
	- Sex became an object of suspicion, disquiting meaning that pervades our conduct and existence in spite of ourselves. Universal secret, omnipresent cause, fear that never ends.
	- Two processes:
		- Demand that sex speak the truth
		- Demand that sex tells us our truth; buried truth which we think we possess in our immediate consciousness.
	- **Knowledge of the subject**, knowledge of that which divides and determines the subject.
		- Causality in the subject, unconscious of the subject, truth of the subject which he holds unbeknown to him, scientific project around the question sex by virtue of the tactics of power immanent in this discourse.

Since the 19th century, *scientia sexualis* also functioned as an *ars erotica*.
- Pleasure in the truth of pleasure, specific pleasure of the true discourse on pleasure, **pleasure of analysis**

## IV. The Deployment of Sexuality
### 1. Objective

Repression is more primary than throttled rebellious energy. Illusion of repression and vanity is exerted afterwards, on the power relation.

Analytics of power can be constituted only free from **"juridico-discursive" representation of power** which neglects the productive effectiveness, strategic resourcefulness and positivity of power:
- Repression of instincts and theory of the law as constitutive of desire both rely on this representation. The only difference is between a promise of liberation and affirmation of desire. 
- *Negative relation* between power and sex (rejection, exclusion, refusal, concealment etc.), the effects of power take the general form of limit and lack.
	- paradox of effectiveness: incapable of doing anything except to render what it dominates incapable of doing anything other than what power allows to do it.
- *Insistence of the rule* : power dictates its law to sex and places it in a binary system (licit-illicit). Power's hold is maintained through discourse, "it speaks and that is the rule".
- *Cycle of prohibition* : power employs nothing more than a law of prohibition (thou shalt not exist, except in darkness and secrecy). "Do not appear if you do not want to disappear".
- *Logic of censorhip* : affirming that sex is not permitted, preventing it from being ssaid, denying that it exists.
	- injunction of nonexistence, nonmanifestation, and silence.
- *uniformity of the apparatus* : effects same at all levels, the subject constituted as he who obeys (legislative power - obedient subject)

Power is accepted as a pure limit on freedom, it is tolerable only on condition that it mask a substantial part of itself. Institutions of power since the Middle Ages, form a unitary regime, identify their will with the law and act through mechanisms of interdiction and sanction.
- *pax et justitita*: peace as prohibition of feudal or private wars and justice as a way of suspending the private settling of lawsuits.
- In Western societies, exercise of power is formulated in terms of law.

Political criticism in 18th century France condemned monarchy which set itself above the laws, but did not challenge the principle of law as the form of power.
- 19th century critique of law carried out the **assumption that power must be exercised in accordance with a fundamental lawfulness.**
- "In political thought and analysis, we still have not cut off the head of the king."

New mechanisms of power are irreducible to the representation of law.
- new: men as living bodies
	- right → technique
	- law → normalization
	- punishment → control
We must consider consider sex without the law and power without the king.

### 2. Method

Power != a general system of domination exerted by one group over another, a system pervading the entire social body.

**Power is the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own organization.**
- No primary existence of a central point.
- Moving substrate of force relations which engender local and unstable states of power.
- Power is everywhere; not because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere.
- Nominalist take: Power is not an institution/structure; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.
- Multiplicity of force relations can be partially coded -never totally- in the form of "war" or "politics", **two strategies for integrating heterogeneous, unstable force relations.**
- Relations of power are immanent in relationships, they are the immediate effects of the divisions which occur in the latter.
- Power comes from below. **There is no binary and all-encompassing opposition between rulrs and ruled at the root of power relations, serving as a general matrix.**
	- cleavage that run through the social body as a whole.
- Power relations are both **intentional and nonsubjective.** They are imbued with calculation, but doesn't result from the decision of an individual subject.
	- anonymous, unspoken strategies which coordinate the tactics.
- Resistance is internal to power and everywhere present.
	- There is no single locus of great Refusal, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary.
	- Resistances **are the odd term in relations of power, they are inscribed in the relations as an irreducible opposite**.

Cautionary prescriptions:
1. *Rule of immanence:* sexuality was constituted as an area of investiagion only because relations of power had established it as a possible object.
2. *Rules of continual variations:* relations of power are matrices of transformations, not static forms of distribution (those that have it, those that don't)
3. *Rules of double conditioning:* there is no two levels of power, no discontinuity.
	- The father is not "representative" of the sovereign or the state, or vice versa. The family and society do not duplicate each other. The family organization was used to support the maneuvers employed for the Malthusian control of the birthrate, for medicalization of sex and psychiatrization of its nongenital forms.
4. *Rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses:* 
	- Silence and secrecy are shelter for power, anchor its prohibitions; they also provide for relatively obscure areas of tolerance. (Big Other of appearances)
		- Sodomy: two-fold operation of extreme severity and widespread tolerance.
		- Social controls into the area of "perversity" accompanied **"reverse" discourse**: homosexuality began to speak in its own behalf, demand that its "naturality" be acknowledge, using the same categories by which it was medically disqualified.

### 3. Domain

Sexuality is an espeially dense transfer point for relations of power, it is not stubborn, necessarily dissobedient drive.

Four strategic unities:
1. *Hysterization of women's bodies*:
	- medicine -- intrinsic pathology of the feminine body
	- the Mother: organic communication with the social body, had to esure the family space and the life of children (biologico-moral responsibility)
2. *Pedagogization of children's sex*:
	- sexual activity natural and contrary to nature at the same time
	- war against onanism, dangers of sexuality need to be monitored, taken charge of
3. *Socialization of procreative behavior*:
	- "responsibilization" of couples with regard to the social body as a whole
	- Medical socialization: pathogenic value attributed to birth-control practices.
4. *Psychiatrization of perverse pleasure*

Four figures: hysterical woman, masturbating child, Malthusian couple, perverse adult.

Production of sexuality; **sexuality as a historical construct, surface network.**
- *deployment of alliance*: system of marriage, fixation of kinship ties, transmission of names and possessions.
	- system of rules, defining the licit and illicit
	- reproduces the interplay of relations and maintains the law that governs them
- *deployment of sexuality*: sensations of the body, quality of pleasures, nature of impressions
	- mobile, polymorphous, contingent techniques of power
	- ensures continual extension of areas and forms of control
	- proliferating, annexing, creating, penetrating bodies in an increasingly detailed way
- problematic of relations → problematic of the "flesh"
	- more secret forms of enjoyment

**Family is the interchange of sexuality and alliance**: it conveys the law in the deployment of sexuality and the economy of pleasure and intensity of sensations in the regime of alliance.
- developed in the family, sexuality is "incestuous" from the start. **Incest is constantly solicited and refused, is continuously demanded for the family to be a hotbed of constant sexual incitement.**
- prohibition of incest as the rule of rules to which all societies are subject, keeps the deployment of sexuality under the system of alliance.
- Family as crystal: 19th century and on, family seemed to be the source of a sexuality which it actually only reflected and diffracted.
- Charcot tried to detach the sphere of sexuality from the system of alliance; separating patients with the promise of returning individuals sexually-compatible with the family system. **Intervention manipulated the sexual body, did not allow for it to define itself in explicit discourse**.
- **Psychoanalysis relocated the alliance (family) at the heart of sexuality**.
	- No risk of alien sexuality, it is constituted through the law (Parents don't be afraid, you'll only learn it is you your children loves.)
	- Christian pastoral vs psychoanalysis:
		- pastoral, the law of alliance codified the flesh.
		- psychoanalysis, sexuality gave body to the rules of alliance by saturating them with desire.

1. family forms labor force
2. *Spatkapitalismus*: exploitation of wage labour relies on controlled circuits of the economy - **hyper-repressive desublimation.**

### 4 Periodization

Two ruptures of repression:
1. 17th century promotion of marital sexuality and reduction to silence.
2. 20th century tolerance, taboos lifted.

18th century, sex required the social body/all individuals to place themselves under surveillance (pedagogy, medicine, demography).
- technology of sex ordered in relation to the problem of life and illness (not death and punishment). **The flesh was brought down to the level of the organism.**
